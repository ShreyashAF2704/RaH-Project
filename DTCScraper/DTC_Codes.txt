P0116 - Engine Coolant Temperature (ECT) Sensor 1 Circuit Range/Performance
Description:     Indicates the engine coolant temperature rationality test has failed. This DTC indicates
                 that the ECT or cylinder head temperature (CHT) value is higher than the calibrated
                 value and could prevent 1 or more on-board diagnostic (OBD) monitors from
                 completing.
                 The PCM runs this logic after an engine off and a calibrated soak period (typically 6
                 hours). This soak period allows the intake air temperature (IAT) and the CHT or ECT to
                 stabilize and not differ by more than a calibrated value. DTC P0116 is set when all of the
                 following conditions are met:
                 The ECT at engine start exceeds the IAT at engine start by more than a calibrated
                 value, typically 17°C (30°F).
                 The ECT exceeds a calibrated value, typically 107°C (225°F).
                 The fuel system, heated oxygen and misfire monitors have not completed.
                 The calibrated time to set DTC P0116 has expired.

Description:           The EGR system is monitored during steady state driving conditions while the EGR
                       is commanded on. The test fails when the signal from the differential pressure
                       feedback EGR (DPFE) sensor indicates that EGR flow is less than the desired
                       minimum.

P0402 - Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) Flow Excessive Detected
Description:       The EGR system is monitored for undesired EGR flow during idle. The EGR monitor
                   looks at the differential pressure feedback EGR (DPFE) signal at idle and compares it
                   to the stored signal measured during key on engine off (KOEO). The test fails when
                   the signal at idle is greater than at KOEO by a calibrated amount.
Possible Causes:          EGR valve stuck open
                          Plugged EGR vacuum regulator solenoid vent

Diagnostic     Compare HO2S upstream HO2S11 and downstream HO2S12 switch rate and amplitude.
Aids:          Under normal closed loop fuel conditions, high efficiency catalysts have oxygen storage
               which makes the switching frequency of the downstream HO2S very slow and reduces the
               amplitude of those switches as compared to the upstream HO2S. As catalyst efficiency
               deteriorates, its ability to store oxygen declines and the downstream HO2S signal begins to
               switch more rapidly with increased amplitude, approaching the switching rate and amplitude
               of the upstream HO2S. Once beyond an acceptable limit the DTC is set.

P0500 - Vehicle Speed Sensor (VSS) A
Description:     Indicates the powertrain control module (PCM) detected an error in the vehicle speed
                 information. Vehicle speed data is received from either the VSS, the transfer case
                 speed sensor (TCSS) or the anti-lock brake system (ABS) control module. If the engine
                 RPM is above the torque converter stall speed (automatic transmission) and the engine
                 load is high, it can be inferred that the vehicle must be moving. If there is insufficient
                 vehicle speed data input, a concern is indicated and a DTC is set. On most vehicle
                 applications the malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) is illuminated when this DTC is set.

                          Duty)
Diagnostic Aids: Monitor the VSS PID while driving the vehicle. This DTC is set when the PCM detects a
                 sudden loss of vehicle speed signal over a period of time. If vehicle speed data is lost,
                 check the source of the vehicle speed input: VSS, TCSS or ABS. Note: On some
                 manual shift-on-the-fly (MSOF) applications, VSS and TCSS PID can be monitored.
                 However if no TCSS PID is available and VSS PID is zero, TCSS circuitry frequency
                 must be checked for loss of sensor signal. If another vehicle electronic module has
                 generated the P0500 and the vehicle does not receive its vehicle speed input from the
                 VSS, TCSS or ABS, check the PCM for output shaft speed (OSS) sensor DTCs. On
                 OSS applications the PCM uses the OSS to calculate the vehicle speed. If no OSS
                 DTCs are found check for correct PCM configuration, tire size and axle ratio.

P050A - Cold Start Idle Air Control Performance
Description: The cold start emission reduction monitor has detected an airflow performance deficiency.
             The cold start emission reduction monitor validates the operation of the components of the
               system required to achieve the cold start emission reduction strategy, retarded spark timing
               (P050B) and elevated idle airflow (P050A). When the idle airflow test portion of the cold
               start emission reduction strategy is enabled, the idle air control system requests a higher
               idle RPM to increase the engine airflow. The cold start emission reduction monitor
               compares the actual airflow measured by the MAF sensor to the requested PCM airflow.
               The DTC is set when the airflow is less than the calibrated limit.

P1000 - On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) Systems Readiness Test Not Complete
Description: The OBD monitors are carried out during the OBD drive cycle. DTC P1000 is stored in
             continuous memory if any of the OBD monitors do not carry out their full diagnostic check.
Possible              The vehicle is new from the factory
Causes:               Battery or powertrain control module (PCM) had recently been disconnected
                      An OBD monitor concern occurred before completion of an OBD drive cycle
                      PCM DTCs have recently been cleared with a scan tool
                      Power take off (PTO) circuit concern or PTO is on during testing.
Diagnostic     This DTC, inspection/maintenance (I/M) readiness function is part of the PCM strategy. A
Aids:          battery disconnection or clearing codes using a scan tool results in the various I/M
               readiness bits being set to a not-ready condition. As each non-continuous OBD monitor
               completes a full diagnostic check, the I/M readiness bit associated with that monitor is set to
               a ready condition. This may take 1 or 2 drive cycles based on whether concerns are
               detected or not. The readiness bits for comprehensive component monitoring (CCM),
               misfire, and fuel system monitoring are considered complete once all the non-continuous
               monitors have been evaluated. Because the EVAP and secondary air injection (AIR) system
               monitors require certain ambient conditions to run, special logic can bypass the monitor for
               the purpose of clearing the EVAP/secondary AIR system I/M readiness bit, due to continued
               presence of these extreme conditions. DTC P1000 does not need to be cleared from the
               PCM except to pass an I/M test. The malfunction indicator lamp (MIL) flashes after a period
               of time with the key in the RUN position (engine not running) if DTC P1000 is set.
