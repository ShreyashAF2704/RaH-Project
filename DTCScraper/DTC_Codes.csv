Disconnect the intake air fresh airplenum from the throttle body. Check for water or oily residue at the PCV fresh air port. Disconnect the tube at the valve cover and check the tube for ice obstruction/ice. Start the engine and, to check the PCV system, place a piece of cardboard on the crankcase vent in the rocker cover. If the cardboard is held on the crankcase vent and fumes are not exiting, reconnect the tube to the valve cover and the intake air port. If the test passes, the PCV system is OK. If the cardboard is not held in place, turn off the engine and check the PCV valve side of the system for ice or obstruction and repair as necessary. If no obstruction is found there, isolate and repair any obstruction in the intake manifold connection. If no obstruction is found there, make sure the PCV coolant heater is functional and repair as necessary. If no concern is present, make sure the PCV valve is allowing the proper vacuum flow and repair as necessary."
