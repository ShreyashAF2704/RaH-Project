My local mechanic, as well as the dealership where I purchased my brand new 2020 Honda Pilot elite awd were unable to address the issue.

At first, once disengaging from aeis at a red light (by releasing my foot from the brake pedal) the radio would shut off and switch back on, but to am radio. What seemed like a few months later, when aeis was disengaging, my whole dashboard went blank and I received a message to \"shift to park + restart engine\". I have tried to be diligent in turning off aeis immediately after starting my vehicle, but in the few times I have forgotten, and my aeis has failed, the dashboard goes blank and the car shifts to neutral (indicated by the red light becoming illuminated around n). My local mechanic looked at this issue in June of 2022, and said that my battery was only holding a 30% charge, so we replaced it. After my most recent Pilot engine electrical failure, I called Honda, and was advised to contact my dealership since I was still covered by the powertrain warranty (<60k miles). To have a vehicle stalled in the middle of the road, once on i75 in stopped traffic in downtown atlanta, is an obvious safety hazard. I was trusting Honda with my family's safety when I purchased my Pilot, but that trust has been lost. Today, November 01, the dealer told me my battery was bad; it's less than 5 months old, mind you.

It took a good almost two minutes of turning off the engine and trying to push the power button back on. It finally did turn on so we did not need a tow, but it was extremely scary to be in the middle of an intersection with a stalled engine. Subsequently the engine stalled a couple of times, briefly flashing an error message on the dashboard before shifting into neutral on its own and then indicating to shift into park. I have had the diagnostic test ($99) done at the Honda dealership (dublin, OH) and was told that they could not replicate the engine stall and that there were no error records recorded in the engine log. A few times, the engine seemed to hesitate like it was on its way to stalling after being in auto idle engine mode, but would start up when I released the brake. Today the engine stalled again when I was at a red light, briefly displaying an error mode and then shifting into neutral on its own again.
