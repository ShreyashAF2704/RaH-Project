On the evening of June 17, 2011, as I was driving along the tappan zee bridge (connecting rockland and westchester counties) in new york, the tire warning indicator went on. Upon my arrival at home (about an 8-minute drive from the bridge), I noticed a hissing sound coming from the rear, driver-side tire and immediately concluded that the tire was deflating. The following morning the tire was flat. After installing the spare, I took the tire to a goodyear dealer. Upon inspection, the mechanic noted that there was a puncture to the sidewall of the tire which should not be repaired, which was the same issue discovered with the front, driver-side tire. I replaced it with a new tire. The tire had approximately 6,500 miles on it the time of the incident. This time I filed a complaint since it was highly coincidental that two tires would fail within a 10-day period with the same fact pattern. I suspect that the vehicle came installed with at least two tires that had weak sidewalls.", "fail date": "  06/07/2011"}]
