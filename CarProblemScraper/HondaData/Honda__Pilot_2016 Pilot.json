Now the car would not be able to start, but more importantly couldn't even be pushed off to the side of the road and clear the intersection, since there is no way to move it into neutral. Another example could be with an alternator failure while driving, where the battery then surges and drains itself, with the engine and car now shut down. If you are unable to move the car to the side of the road as this is happening, maybe stuck in traffic or stopped at a traffic light, the car is now unmovable until a tow truck driver arrives and installs this mechanical neutral unlock device.

Since early 2018 we have been having issues with the idle stop system. The problem is when we are driving and we come to stop in traffic at a light, the idle stop system engages and shuts the engine down, like it is suppose to do. Once the light turns green for traffic to move, I release the brake and the idle stop system tries to engage and turn the engine on again, but fails and shuts the whole vehicle down, inoperable. The lights flash and I cannot turn the car on again for at least 1 to 2 minutes. Vehicles are honking and traffic is blaring across us, but I cannot turn the vehicle back on. After 2 minutes, I can restart the vehicle by pushing the button and brake and then the vehicle moves. This is a safety issue, since you never know when it wil lol happen, but it has always happened while in heavy trafffic or a busy intersection. In 2019, I took vehicle in for service, they said it was a bad battery. I replaced the battery in March 2019. The same identical problem still continued to occur multiple times. November 10 took the same dealer, howdy Honda, austin,TX. They again told me the battery was reading bad, but I had the battery tested at another shop and at the place of purchase, and the battery was more then fine and tested great in and out of the vehicle. The dealer of course said they could not recreate the issue and did not see anything when they tested the system. They just pawned it off on the battery, even though the battery is less than 2 years old and testing just fine. There is no way to permanently disable the system and if I forget to push the idle stop disengage button every time I start the vehicle, I could end up on the road in the middle of traffic and some driver decides not to pay attention and run into me and my disabled vehicle.

I believe the first instance was in sept 2021 (after the lemon law time frame passed for my state). When my vehicle is stopped, I try to hit the gas and the vehicle does not go. At this same time an error happens on the screen that says \"shift car to p\". The first few times this has happened I tried to shift to p and that did not help. I figured out that it is best (I. E. Quickest, I am not sure it is the best for the vehicle) to just turn the car off. Wait a few seconds, and then turn the car back on and put it back into drive and go. Keep in mind that I have cars peeling by me, screaming at me, honking, yelling, etc. All with my 6/7yo daughter in the vehicle. I am often stuck in an intersection going left. Additionally, sometimes but not always, the radio and heat/ac turn off when this happens. This has occurred far more times than I can count but a few examples in bumper to bumper city traffic, when waiting to make a left hand turn in intersections, while taking turns at a stop sign both flat and uphill (which is terrifying), just while being stopped at red lights and having the light turn green, when taking turns to enter a rotary, when trying to go at a yield sign, etc. There is no warning light or lamp. The warning lights/sounds occur while/after its already happened. Sometimes the radio turns off and the heat/ac. I have had the vehicle repeatedly serviced by the dealer I purchased it from. They said they cannot replicate the issue. They have asked me to take video of it which is infuriating and unsafe as I am in the vehicle with a child in traffic, sometimes in the middle of an intersection, trying not to get t-boned. We have changed the battery. The dealer has cleaned carbon build up out of something.

I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the \"brake\" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the \"road. \" in either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared / continued to become increasingly more clear of my path.

My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor CO. , inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1. At high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2. The \u00bfauto idle off\u00bf feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver.
