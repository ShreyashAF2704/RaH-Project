However, they replaced the \"box\" which the accelerator connects to and told me the problem should be fixed. 3 days after returning the car to me, the same incident occurred a 3rd time. This time the vehicle fluids were also overheating. I left the car running until a Honda technician could come and take a look and see the problem in action.

The relationship seems to correlate with the visual eco display on the dashboard. The issue can be categorized by progressing through three stages or modes as speed and driving conditions vary. The first mode can be characterized as a howling (significant audible tone change) from the engine right before the vibration begins, which is the second mode. The second mode is the vibration/shudder most predominately around 44 mph, but can occur at other speeds - depending on the \"load\" on the engine. The shudder/vibration can vary from a high frequency vibration (like going over small narrow rumble strips) to a more pronounced shudder, both of which is can be felt by passengers and/or driver. In general, the Pilot will vibrate/shudder consistently, apparently when the vcm feature is in transition. However, on two occasions, a third mode occurred: very suddenly while driving about 45 mph or so, by surprise, the Pilot shook (front end area) to such a intense degree that it impulsively caused the driver of the Pilot to pull-over and stop. Not knowing what really is going on is causing some trepidation about whether to even drive the car. Took Pilot into the dealer and explained these modes. Dealer was aware of the vcm related vibrations and says that is the way it works and nothing they can do. But, to me this is a real safety issue. A brand new (rather costly) car should not behave this way. Moreover, it seems such regular ongoing vibration/shuddering can quickly negatively impact the integrity or longevity of the engine/drive train, etc. , as most mechanical things generally do not like vibrations which quite often is a significant source of wear and tear. As the owner one must ask things like: will the engine even \"survive\" this in the long run? will this cause more frequent repairs?.", "fail date": "  10/01/2013"}, {"Vehicle": "Honda", "Model": "Pilot", "Model Year": "2013 Pilot", "Problem": "Equipment", "Sub Problem": "Equipment problems", "description": "Every time I drive the car I hear some rattle- squeaky kind of noises coming from the passenger front seat , I have taken the car 4 times already and the technician hasn't been able to fix the problem .", "fail date": "  08/17/2013"}, {"Vehicle": "Honda", "Model": "Pilot", "Model Year": "2013 Pilot", "Problem": "Equipment", "Sub Problem": "Equipment problems", "description": "I was driving on hwy got a flat tire.

Then the second time the check engine light came on they told me they cleaned the pistons and I should be good. The third time I brought the car back to them all in about three weeks, they said OH. . . You need $3k to do this procedure which Honda recommends and then I lost it. I realized I was being played and I took it to independent mechanic which brought this to my attention. I have been trying to contact american Honda over the phone and they do not answer any calls. The number rings 3 times then plays some music and then ends the call. I also sent them an email which caused mr mario representing american Honda, to call me. I missed his call and I called him back multiple times but he is never in the office.
