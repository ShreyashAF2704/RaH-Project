I was in a parking garage, and no structure trucks were available to tow from the spot the car was disabled. The plan was to put it into neutral and push it to the street where it could be towed. The owner's manual does not tell what to do. The dealer didn't know, either. If it's googled, a youtube video comes up, that identifies an oddly shaped device or bolt deep in the engine compartment. But even the aaa mechanic who came to the scene,with all his tools, could not get it to turn. I asked the dealership if there was any other way and ultimately they said \"no. \" they later told me, after doing some research, that Honda has a special tool, requiring three extensions, used to accomplish this during transport to the dealer. This seem quite unsafe. Obviously, cars can be disabled in many ways. Without a reasonably accessible means of putting the car in neutral, it cannot be moved in an emergency situation (for example, out of a lane of traffic). It definitely can't be done by an owner (unless, I suppose it's someone who has the ability to google during the emergency, finds the video, and has the special tool). Please note the car wash feature will not work because the engine has to be running for that. When I first brought this up, no one at the dealership knew anything about this defect.

My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy. When informed about this to Honda, Honda was referring to geico, that they will do the investigation. Geico says that its not their problem and Honda should do the investigation. As a common man I would like to have this problem investigated and necessary action to be taken. I see they subrogate each other, which is not correct.
