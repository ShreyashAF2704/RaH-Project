When they said they were through and it might be a flat spot on a tire I reported this to Honda motor cars of America case # [xxx]. I had a separate dealer check it out and they agree it is there but had no solution. They said all the safety equipment is in place and it may be a bent rim, bad tire or just the vehicle itself. I was called by the dealer where I bought it to bring it to an affiliate Honda dealer. They force balanced again and adjusted the alignment. It was a bit better but again still shakes. They then swapped tires and rims with an identical 2007 Pilot with new goodyear integrity tires (recommended as the tire that came on the vehicle)there was not difference. The 2007 when taken for a test ride was worse than my vehicle and someone will by that thinking it is just an alignment and have the same problem. Looking on line this is a problem with Pilots, Acura rdx and mdx vehicles of all years when used for highway driving.

Keys on key ring caught within recess in the back of the steering wheel (recess is exposed to keys because of right turn), and lodged against casing that contains the key assembly, with the result of the steering wheel completely locking in the right turned position while moving, causing complete loss of steering control. I was able to stop the car without accident since no car was in the parking spaces at that time. Was only able to remove jammed key/steering wheel condition (after stopping) when Honda key broke, releasing the electronic portion of key from the metal portion, allow the wedging of the other key to release. Combination of keys on key ring and low speed full right turn cause the dangerous condition. Dangerous condition for other motorist with many keys (8) on relatively small key ring, allowing some keys on ring to point towards steering wheel rather than downwards.
