She approached the guard booth and came to a complete stop. This can be verified as the guard stopped her and they had a brief conversation about where to park. Lisa then accelerated out of the guard booth while making an immediate low speed right turn down a ramp into a parking garage. From this point the Honda Pilot continued to accelerate down the ramp as she applied the brakes. The car accelerated out of control and failed to brake. It jumped a small median and eventually hit a concrete block wall at the bottom of the ramp. Lisa maintains that she was applying the brakes during the descent down the ramp up the moment of impact and the car was still continuing to accelerate and brakes did not respond. I contacted Honda and submitted a written request that the event data recorder (edr) be tested. A representative from Honda called me on September 6 (I was only given a first name of reggie) he explained that on or about August 19 a technician examined the vehicle and determined that no pre accident data could be recovered. He explained that while the 2012 Honda Pilot has an edr only some of these vehicles have the ability to record pre accident data and that mine did not have this ability. He also said that I would not receive a report or any confirmation in writing about the incident or subsequent examination of the vehicle. The owner manual indicates that edrs has the ability to record data up to 30 seconds prior to the accident it will report if the accelerator or brake was being activated at the moment of impact.

The steering would vibrate when applying the brakes. I took it to the dealership on 28th. The dealership told me I was \" hard braking\" and that was causing the rotors to warp. I asked them to clarified \" hard braking. \" it was just a general answer that no abrupt force on the brakes. I have driven Toyota, Buick, oldsmobiles, and chevy. I never had a rotor warped that early in mileage. I believed there is a major defects in the Pilot 2012 braking mechanism. I wish some agency can perform more rigid tests to confirm this. I am no expert mechanic, but I have driven many miles due to my sales position both in highway and mostly city driving.
