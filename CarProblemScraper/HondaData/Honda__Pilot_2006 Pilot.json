I am the first owner of this SUV and noticed the problem during the very first year itself. That time my vehicle failed to stop on a stop sign. The problem I faced was when I applied brake, the car didn't stop and it continued in the acceleration mode and finally stopped after crossing the stop sign. I had reported this problem immediately to the Honda dealer, from where I purchased the vehicle. They inspected the vehicle and returned to me saying that they didn't find any problem. In fact they laughed at me that I didn't apply the brake properly. The dealer didnt document my concern. After that till now (almost 4 years) I am experiencing this kind of problem quite often. Because of this problem, I have to always make sure to brake an additional 2 or 3 feet ahead of my proposed stop as the vehicle may not stop where I think it should stop. If it does not stop, I brake harder and at that time I hear the acceleration is still on. I always ignored this problem mainly because this happens quite randomly like maybe a couple of times every month. I have not been able to figure out what exactly triggers this. Recently after reading about the Toyota recall, I have a feeling that my vehicle also has the similar problems and I notified the american Honda company.

We were driving at around 20 mph and as we gently braked in approach of the stop sign, the engine opened up nearly full throttle at just above 5000 rpms. My husband immediately and firmly applied the brake and placed the gear in park. With his foot on the brake, not the accelerator pedal, the engine continued to roar at 5000 rpms until he turned it off at the ignition after about 30 seconds. He restarted the engine and the engine rpm immediately shot up to 5000 rpms again, with his foot on the brake and the car in park. The tachometer stayed at the 5000 rpm level continuously until he again turned off the engine at the ignition after about 45 seconds. We waited a few more seconds and re-started the engine again. That time, the engine started at a normal rpm and we drove half a block to our house. We recorded a video of the second episode of 5000 rpms with a camera we had with us. We provided the video immediately to american Honda customer service. At the request of customer service, I took our Pilot to brickell Honda in miami on March 1. I showed the video of the sua to the service manager, george ruiz, on his computer. He was astounded by what he saw and expressed his genuine concern that the car was unsafe to operate, regardless of whether his service department was able to find the source of the problem. He said under no circumstance should the engine operate at 5000 rpms without the accelerator being depressed almost all the way to the floor. The district service manager, kevin mcclung, also inspected the car. American Honda determined the Pilot was operating within normal parameters. We were instructed to pick up the car on March 5 and did so on March 8. No repairs were performed.
