On or about April 2022, we started experiencing the start/stop issue while living in kansas. When the issue occurred, an error message would flash very briefly across the dash, quick enough where we could not take a picture of the message. Our Honda would stutter then start back up. At this point, we took it to the legends Honda dealership [10050 parallel pkwy, kansas city, KS 66109] and after a free diagnostic they told us they could not a) replicate the issue, b) find evidence of the error message in the system. The next week, we had a complete engine failure while at a stop light for a full 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, the engine remained off, the transmission shifted to park on its own, and the vehicle could not be restarted manually. Traffic built up behind and around us as we were trying to figure out how to get off the road and we could not turn the hazard lights on. It seems this issue is related to an electrical component. After 5 minutes, we were able to push the ignition button to turn off the car completely and restart the engine. The vehicle operated normally afterwards.

Once again, the transmission shifted itself to park, an error message flashed across the screen briefly this time, and after 5 mins we could manually restart the car and continue as normal. Between these catastrophic failure dates, we would experience multiple start/stop stutters with error msg the only experience we have where this would not occur is to manually turn off the auto start/stop feature when driving the car.

Aei shuts the engine off when the car is in drive but fully stopped and, in theory, increases fuel efficiency by reducing engine idling when the car is stopped, e. G. At a stoplight or in stop-and-go traffic. While there is a button to disable it, this button has to be pressed each time you turn the car on and cannot be permanently disabled.

When this happens, for a very brief time (too short to get a photo) warning lights related to the collision and/or emergency braking systems flash. After those lights go away, the dashboard lights indicate that the vehicle is in neutral (not by my doing) and that I must press the brake, put the vehicle in park, and restart the vehicle. This process does not always work the first time and the delay of turning off and restarting the car, even when it does work, causes a dangerous situation in traffic. When this happens on a downward hill, my vehicle rolls forward as it \u201cdies\u201d and I am sometimes stuck in the middle of an intersection as I try to restart the vehicle as quickly as I can. When it happens in heavy stop and go freeway traffic, I\u2019m often surrounded by vehicles traveling at high speeds. I\u2019m terrified that my baby and toddler will be hurt in this vehicle.
