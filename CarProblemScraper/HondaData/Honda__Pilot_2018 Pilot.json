We tow the trailer dry, which is without water in the black, gray and fresh tanks. We do not load any items of significant weight in the trailer (two lightweight camp chairs, a 3-inch thick foam mattress topper and pillows). We have towed the trailer from akron, ohio, to twentynine palms, CA, in 2020 and to glacier national park, mt, in 2021. We have also towed it to several ohio state parks. In the fall of 2021, the vehicle\u2019s transmission began to exhibit unusual performance that manifested itself as gear shifting hesitation in the range of 1,500 \u2013 2,000 rpms. With that issue, we took it to great lakes Honda which changed the transmission fluid (great lakes did not flush the transmission) at 28,000 miles. On April 3, 2022, the transmission hesitation began again. I took it to apple tree Honda in arden, nc, (we had moved to waynesville, nc, in late 2021) on April 5, 2022, a technician found no error codes, but performed a transmission flush and fill. . My issue with this is that the transmission fluid should not degrade in 7,000 miles of normal driving, causing transmission malfunction. The vehicle does seem capable of towing a weight near the published owner's manual maximum of 3,500 pounds. With this interval, I am concerned that the Honda stated operational guidelines are false, and the vehicle\u2019s transmission might continue to degrade as many other Honda Pilots\u2019 transmissions have as reported by many owners. The apple tree Honda technician who worked on the Pilot, advised me to add an auxiliary automatic transmission cooler, which is necessary if towing more than 3500 lbs. Since the April service, I have not towed the trailer.

Unfortunately during this first winter I have found out that this vehicle does not have a functioning heater. As soon as the weather turned cold I noticed that this new Honda Pilot did not have sufficient heat. While driving at highway speeds the heater functions ok but during city driving, or especially at idle, the temperature falls well below any acceptable minimum requirements. Below is a chart showing a comparison between a functioning heater in a 2014 crv versus this new 2018 Honda Pilot. Please note the differences in outside air temperatures: the crv measurements were taken at an outside air temp of -8\ufffd while the Pilot data was recorded with an outside air temp of + 8\ufffd. The vent temperature varies considerably based on the engine rpm. While accelerating the temperature is warm / hot but while driving in traffic or stopped the temperature can drop 80 degrees or more in 1-2 minutes. Based on this data, I made two separate appointments to have the Pilot serviced under warranty at my local Honda dealer. The weather on the 2nd visit was cold (-17 degrees f). They \ufffdverified the complaint\ufffd and found that the vent temperature from a fully warmed up engine was 28 degrees (yes, below freezing!). They said they have another Pilot in their shop that does the same thing therefore there is nothing wrong with mine and considered mine as functioning \ufffdnormal\ufffd. They did not do any diagnostic work and refused to do any work, even simple work such as trying to flush the heater core or remove any air from the system. They stated that Honda put in an undersized heater core in the Pilot and therefore they were not going to waste their time trying to fix. Since I live in chicago there are 5 months of cold weather so I do not consider a lack of heat a minor inconvenience nor an acceptable to live with.", "fail date": "  01/01/2019"}, {"Vehicle": "Honda", "Model": "Pilot", "Model Year": "2018 Pilot", "Problem": "Equipment", "Sub Problem": "Equipment problems", "description": "Vehicle auto locked with keys in car and could not unlock.
