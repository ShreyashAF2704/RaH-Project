Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone.

The problem is the transmission cooler is built into the bottom of the radiator. The cooler sits in the bottom of the radiator. There are two transmission fittings on the out side of the radiator that attach to the transmission. This brings transmission fluid in the radiator cooler, cools the fluid and returns it to the transmission. Now inside the bottom radiator sits the transmission cooler which is just a small pipe witch is attached to the transmission fittings. When the fluid enters the radiator cooler it gets instantly cooled and returned to transmission because the cooler is submerged in radiator fluid. This is because the bottom of the radiator is the coolest at the bottom. What's happening is the transmission fittings are rusting away and failing allowing radiator fluid to enter the return line to the transmission. When radiator fluid enters the transmission the transmission is done. You need a replacement. These problem is happening to several Hondas and nissin.

The vehicle was leased for 3 years, and I worked the deal on the car on the internet. When a price was agreed to, I drove to butler to pick up the vehicle, however, I test drove it first. It had a very noticeable shimmy, and a shudder when driving at 50mph speeds and up. I told the salesman that this was unacceptable, so we returned to the dealership, and drove 3 other '05 Pilots on the lot, all with the same problem. The salesman and sales manager said this was a result of putting new tires on all of these vehicles, and after driving the vehicle for a while, the ride would smooth out. Well, I swallowed this line of crap, hook, line, and sinker, and after returning home, and driving the Pilot for a couple weeks, I replaced the new kumho tires with oem goodyear integrity tires, and had the wheels balanced twice, once at Honda dealer, and again at local tire shop, with latest state of the art balancing machines. After all this, the shimmering and shuddering is still as bad as it was when I brought the vehicle home, and I cannot drive this thing at highway speeds. After much research on the internet lately, I have found literally thousands of complaints from Pilot owners with the same problem that I am having. I paid $16500 for this vehicle, and can't even drive it out of town, and I'm not going to sit still and accept this as my fate.
