13,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"When the vehicle is in motion and I have to press down on the gas to accelerate/ speed up the vehicle quickly the driver seat bounces backwards/moves and it feels like its going to come off the frame its mounted to like some bolts may be broke or something. The car locks are messed up. The both front door locks have to be unlocked with a key. The inside unlock mechanism only unlocks the driver side passenger door and the trunk. In order to unlock the passenger front and the passenger rear locks a window has to be rolled down and you have to reach in and manually unlock it and those also have to be manually locked back when you exit the vehicle. Also, the passenger air unit does work. It does not blow out air even with the rear control on. The inside car lights have to be manually cut on and off and not set to come on when the door opens and closes because it runs the battery down. Sometimes while driving the headlights flicker. And the power port to charge phones, etc. Works but anything plugged into it gets hot real fast. All that points to electrical issues. The air bag lights kept coming on and going off. The transmission light has been flashing d and did not stop until fluid and filter was changed. So far that seems to have helped. And last but not least, the contacts in the ignition switch act defected. The key has to remain in the ignition switch and the spare key has to be used to unlock the car because if the key is removed, it does not want to go back into the switch to crank the car. The switch does not want to accept the key and turn to crank the engine once it has been removed from the switch. Even trying to turn the steering wheel and pressing the brake to release the switch doesn't work. And the gear shift stick/shaft acts almost like it's not park, but it was put in park.",  06/20/2016
14,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,Had to replace water pump and belt payed for it at homda dealer then noticed it had a recall on it dealership didnt notify me of the recall. Now I'm having problems with the transmition dealership said they couldn't find the problem but it also has a recall. But when I searched my VIN it said no recalls were found. The transmition periodically comes out of gear if I stop quickly or 1st thing in the morning or if I go over a speed bump slowly or sometimes randomly in the middle of driving in traffic. I can switch it into 1st 2nd or 3rd and get it moving again. It hasn't happend at high speeds yet. And the the metal under the seats is all rusted. At this rate the transmition will cause me to have an accident and the seats will come off and the airbags that have also been recalled will kill us im highly dissapointed in this vehicle.,  06/08/2016

19,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"On may 26, 2015, I was traveling north on I-5 at 60 mph when the wheels of my car seized. At which point the car began a rigorous slide, black smoke billowed as the tread of my tires peeled off. The force of the slide eventually jammed the tires sideways causing the car to hop as it propelled forward, finally coming to a stop about a mile from the starting point. Needless to say it was a horrific ride, which still causes me some stress. The car was towed to bill's tech trans where they informed me that the transmission was faulty. Bill's sent the faulty transmission to the maker. At that time I was unaware of the recall on Honda Pilot 2003 transmissions. After hearing of the recall a couple of months later, I informed american Honda of my incident. They requested receipts pertaining to the incident which I provided in full 3 times. One of the four customer service representatives had lost some or all of the paperwork that I had sent. It has been a year and a half of dealing with american Honda and they continue to put me off, even closing the claim at one point; they sent a letter which stated, ""we have attempted to contact you in regards to your request, but have not been successful in reaching you. "" I called immediately and they informed me they had closed the claim due to my lack of responding to their phone calls. I told them that both my home phone and cell phone keep logs of who calls and that they are not on either one. American Honda reopened the case. Since then I have been rebuffed repeatedly. About a month ago I was told someone was reviewing the case for possible reimbursement and have heard nothing since. It seems as if they do not want to honor the recall on the 2003 Honda Pilot transmission. Is there anything you can do to help? american Honda recall case no. 04263486.",  05/26/2015

23,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"We purchased our 2003 Honda Pilot ex-l new at danbury Honda on February 20, 2003. We have had ongoing issues with the ""d"" or drive light flashing intermittently since the car was new and had it checked at the dealer each time, with a report back that there was nothing wrong and it would go away. The dealer has done almost all of the preventative maintenance to our vehicle and we also do proactive care to our vehicle. Most recently we spent a good amount of money on repairs to the transmission through Honda dealerships in delray beach, florida (disaster there) and danbury, CT. We are now being told we need a new transmission, only months after putting a lot of money into the car. Had we known we would be spending this kind of money (about $5k), we would have traded the car in. However, we are now caught in a financial burden with having to put a new transmission in the 2003 Pilot, which we think should be part of a recall based upon all the on-line research we've done. Can anyone please assist?.",  07/22/2013

25,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"We bought a 2003 Honda Pilot in 2006. 3 months ago we found out it had been recalled in 2004 for the powertrain. That apparently was fixed at that time. In April, we had an issue with the rpms showing 3000 while we were driving only 35 mph. We took it to the dealer who informed us that the powertrain needed to be replaced. This cost us over $6,000 to replace including over $700 to lease a car. American Honda said that the warranty had run out and that it was a high mileage vehicle and they would not cover the cost of the repair. Our question is why would the powertrain have to be replaced a second time within a 9 year period. The 109,000 miles on the vehicle is within if not lower than the national average. Granted, a 10 year old vehicle will probably not still be under warranty. However, if the powertrain was fixed under the recall in 2004, should it need to be replaced again?.",  04/12/2013

They wanted me to pay over 15,000 for the car and finally after debating for hours over 4. They sold me the car out the door with no warranty offered for 10,500. I was very happy and I have 2 children and one on the way. I bought the car on August 5, 2012 less than two week go by and I am driving home going 65mph on 71 and the car jerks down gears to 30 miles an hour in a split second. My neck and my back are both hurting and I do not want to sue nor try to get rich off of this. My complaint is, I took the car to[xxx] of colerain the next morning they said the transmission was bad and they could do nothing for me. So basically they said I will have to pay for a $7,000 dollar repair. I left the car there and came home did all kinds of research found that car is up for recall on the transmission and thousands of people have the same issue. They even have a facebook page dedicated to fixing this problem! how can Honda keep these vehicle's on the road? if my 17 month old would have been in the car with me she would have maybe broke her neck. Go drive 65mph and throw the car in reverse that is what happened to me! and they said I bought a certified used Honda? so what do I do ? who do I call? and why can they sell me a car in such a state? with over 4 recalls on parts and one being potentially fatal.

Then days later is when it burned to the ground, even the tires were gone. Honda doesn't care about our loss, and of course it's not their fault. P. S. In 2007 we got hurt in that same car we were stopped on the side of the road ( we were in the car) and a truck crossed the line and hit us head on. Our seat belts didn't hold us in, they loosened and airbags did not deploy. We were hurt and Honda said the truck hit us too high is why the airbags didn't deploy. That sounds ridiculous.

I am an older, cautious driver and have babied this vehicle, doing all regular service at the dealer's, so it would run in top shape for many years to come. Around six months ago I noticed at lower speeds (20-30 m. P. H. ) the vehicle shudders. To counter the problem I have to accelerate and then it goes away. I have had the dealer check it three times and each time they say they cannot replicate the problem, which is hard to believe. Last week the d light started to flash. I took it into the dealer right away and they said it was a sensor. I asked if that could be making the car shudder and they said probably. I had them change it and the shudder has not gone away. This morning it was particularly heavy so I called the dealer again and they gave me the american Honda number. I called them and they said the dealer should look at it. I've seen so many other people have the same complaint and I'm very concerned this is a safety issue that Honda is choosing to ignore; a little like other auto companies have done over the past few years until a fatality happens.

In doing the current airbag recall work, the covers became permanently fingerprinted at the dealership. Again filed a complaint with Honda, explaining that not only are the covers even more unsightly because of the fingerprinting on the dashboard, it becomes a safety issue because you refrain from using the horn when needed because of the sticky nature of the cover, which leaves a residue on your hand.

177,Honda,Pilot,2003 Pilot,Structure,Body problems,"The rear driver side electric door lock mechanism is jammed not allowing the door to be locked or unlocked either manually or electrically. This, I imagine, can happen with any door. Luckily, the jam is in the unlocked position allowing the door to be opened. What is not safe is that door cannot be locked leaving the car vulnerable to theft or car jacking. If the door was jammed in the locked position, this can be unsafe for passenger exit in the event of emergency (a fire or emersion in water). Any electric door lock mechanism made by any vehicle manufacturer should be designed to fail safe allowing manual locking and unlocking of the door in the event of electrical power lock mechanism failure. This is just as much a safety issue as a jammed seat belt or faulty airbag. This should be a no cost repair by manufacturer dealerships like they do with jammed seat belts or faulty airbags. At least they should be able to free up the lock mechanism without charge to customers. This needs to be seriously reviewed and addressed by NHTSA for safety with policy and repair procedures and practices clearly spelled out.

In order to unlock the passenger front and the passenger rear locks a window has to be rolled down and you have to reach in and manually unlock it and those also have to be manually locked back when you exit the vehicle. Also, the passenger air unit does work. It does not blow out air even with the rear control on. The inside car lights have to be manually cut on and off and not set to come on when the door opens and closes because it runs the battery down. Sometimes while driving the headlights flicker. And the power port to charge phones, etc. Works but anything plugged into it gets hot real fast. All that points to electrical issues. The air bag lights kept coming on and going off.

This seat is rarely sat in and almost never moved. It became jammed in the upright at some point in time, likely much earlier than I detected it in July 2009. I attempted to fold the seat down via the top lever and was not able to. The result was the top lever plastic handle broke off the cable actuator. I paid over $200 at the dealer (priority Honda in huntersville nc, 28078 - 704. 875. 3100) to have it fixed even though I feel that it should not have jammed causing the top lever to break off. At repair, nothing was found that would cause the jam such as a foreign object or any damage. Recently I tried to move the seat forward (side lever engages both back fold down and base release) to allow my children to exit from the third row seat and found that this lever was not working as well. I brought the vehicle to the above-mentioned dealer the evening of 8/24/09 and left it with them until the evening of 8/24. Ed jenkins the service manager advised me that he personally worked with the mechanic to look at the issue spending three hours working on it and could not repair it. He also told me that a new seat frame was required to make the seat operational. A seat should not fail after 6 years with light use and in my opinion should last as long as or exceed the lifetime of the vehicle, which in the us is about thirteen years I consider this a manufacturing defect and an important safety issue as passengers may become entrapped in the third row seat.

We have a backless boaster seat in the third row on the driver's side, a boaster seat in the third row on the passenger side, and a forward facing car seat in the second row driver's side. It is incredible difficult for me to get the children in the third row buckled because the seat belts are constantly getting ""stuck"" and have to be rethread all the way back. This is difficult because they get caught on the boaster seats that then have to be picked up and moved around to get the seat belt off. Also, the seat on the seat on the passenger side is too narrow and the seat belt buckles very low, close to the seat and it ends up underneath the boaster seat. These difficulties make it nearly impossible for my preschoolers to buckle by themselves and forces me to climb back in their seat to fix the seat belts and move the booster seat forward to buckle them in. It is incredible difficult and uncomfortable for an adult to climb into the third row seat, especially one that is seven months pregnant.

I have had the dealer check it three times and each time they say they cannot replicate the problem, which is hard to believe. Last week the d light started to flash. I took it into the dealer right away and they said it was a sensor. I asked if that could be making the car shudder and they said probably. I had them change it and the shudder has not gone away. This morning it was particularly heavy so I called the dealer again and they gave me the american Honda number. I called them and they said the dealer should look at it.

Similar issue happened on 2 previous occasions. 1st at least 8 months ago and then again about 3 weeks before accident (was going to address with dealer at next oil change) but on two prior occurrences surge occurred when brakes were tapped to disengage cruise control - same pause/surge but not nearly as intense and stopped immediately when brakes were pressed again. After the accident I noted that there are several reports of the same thing happening to other people. No idea how fast it was going when it crashed but it ""felt"" like at least 50mph. This is terrifying when it happens, I don't want to see this happen to anyone else. I shudder to think what would have happened if this had occurred at an intersection or on the expressway - we might not be here. . . Also mailing letter to manufacturer.",  01/27/2016

I took it into the dealer right away and they said it was a sensor. I asked if that could be making the car shudder and they said probably. I had them change it and the shudder has not gone away.

We have a backless boaster seat in the third row on the driver's side, a boaster seat in the third row on the passenger side, and a forward facing car seat in the second row driver's side. It is incredible difficult for me to get the children in the third row buckled because the seat belts are constantly getting ""stuck"" and have to be rethread all the way back. This is difficult because they get caught on the boaster seats that then have to be picked up and moved around to get the seat belt off. Also, the seat on the seat on the passenger side is too narrow and the seat belt buckles very low, close to the seat and it ends up underneath the boaster seat. These difficulties make it nearly impossible for my preschoolers to buckle by themselves and forces me to climb back in their seat to fix the seat belts and move the booster seat forward to buckle them in.

I took it to a repair shop who said it needed the rear differential serviced. That did not stop the shuddering. Subsequent research has shown that the Honda Pilot / Acura mdx with the 3. 5l v6 in the 2003 - 2008(?) range experience this problem on a large scale, resulting from a faulty torque converter.

And there are no recalls for our Pilot at all. The recall involved 1099796 units -- including the 2003 and 2004 model yr Pilots. Honda America does not want to acknowledge that our VIN was -- or at the very least should have been -- in the recall. The Honda America rep was abrupt and repeated the same scripted line over and over . . . ""your VIN is not under any recall. . . "" the dealership has been supportive. We don't know if there will be any discount from either Honda America or the dealer. Our 1999 odyssey had to have transmission replaced just out of warranty -- and this was the vehicle Honda promised to be the best of the best for quality and safety. We will be selling or trading the Pilot and looking for something out of the Honda line. The powertrain should have 100,000 miles -- not the 36,000. I want Honda America to look into our problem , step up and say this issue is the same issue in the recall. Our Pilot was serviced on schedule through the dealer. The Honda America rep said they don't look at what websites say about Honda issues (edmunds, safecar. Gov. . . ).

339,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Power Train,Automatic Transmission Torque Converter problems,"I now have been the victim for the 2nd time of what is unquestionably a major design flaw in the transmission / torque converter of the shared power train for Honda Pilots ('03 ,'04) Honda odyssey vans ('02 to '04) & Acura mdx ('01, '02). I owned a pristine 2001 Acura mdx with just over 100k miles on it which experienced the all too common trans. / torque converter failure only a few months after I purchased it from a Honda dealer. This happened in spite of the fact that the power train recall (sanctioned by NHTSA) had been completed in 2004. I parted ways with the vehicle, incurring a substantial loss. But the nightmare continues, as unfortunately, my other vehicle is a 2004 Honda Pilot. Right after I purchased it new in 2004, I took it back to the dealer since the model was subject to a nearly identical power train recall as the mdx and odyssey. My dealer said my VIN was not included in the recall, & that my new Pilot should be fine. Yet @ 60k, the ""d"" light on the shifter display started to blink from time to time. Each time the dealer said everything was fine; shuttering on downshifting over the years was passed off by the dealer as normal for the vehicle. Then last week, the power train failed on this vehicle as well. This time my son was driving, & the car shuttered so badly that it nearly went out of control. This car has been well maintained & I have all service records. Clearly the recall ""remedy"" for this major design flaw has not solved the issue, and these power trains still present a major safety hazard for the vehicle operator & others on the road who may need to avoid a disabled vehicle in front of them. Please do something! if you total all the power train complaints for the recall yrs. On these 3 models, you get nearly 3000. The legitimacy of NHTSA is at stake.

358,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Seats,Seats problems,"When sitting down in my vehicle this morning, there was a snapping noise and the seat rocked back toward the right rear. Removing the plastic cover, it was plainly visible that a metal part that holds the upper seat to the lower seat assembly has snapped where it attaches with two industrial rivets. Seat now tips backward rather easily, and does so when I climb in or out of the vehicle, and upon acceleration. Clearly the structural integrity of this seat is destroyed until I can have it fixed/replaced. I am fearful that if I were to have an accident, the seat will come completely detached. In a 5 min web search I have found dozens of other instances of this occurring; this is not a rare problem and needs to be fixed! compounding my problem, I am in the usaf stationed in the uk, and getting this fixed will be difficult to say the least, as this vehicle is not sold here.",  08/14/2015

Honda as recalls now for bad airbags. 1- our 2004 does not fall into the recall period 2 - Honda should pay for any issue related to bad airbag technology regardless of how old the car is, just like they do with seat belts. If we would have been in a wreck during the time that light was on, the airbag would not have deployed. 3- any part of the airbag/sensor/ seatbelt system should not be merely covered under a limited warranty.

On 3/19/2010, the dealer called me and said the no. 5 spark plug came out and burned out the coil, it's a very unusual situation. I went to the dealer to check the damages: the spark plug only has the metal portion left, the coil burned out and only 1/3 or 1/2 left, the cylinder head got some damage too and some metal chips remained in the cylinder head and cylinder. I did the oil changes and maintenance at dealership regularly and drove the car gently. I don't think this incident is related to my driving style. It has to be quality issue on either the coil or the spark plug. But I am not a mechanics and don't know if this happened to other cars. Although the car is out of warranty (3 years/36k miles), I really think it's a serious quality issue. Honda needs to take care of this issue.

After smelling gasoline type fumes off for some time (no one else in the family could smell it) and after consulting the Honda Pilot forums, I decided to replace the factory ngk pzfr5f-11 spark plugs at 99,430, rather than the Honda recommended 105,000 miles. I was surprised to discover that the middle rear plug was only finger tight and as a result combustion gasses were escaping between the plug and the head. According to what I read, loose plugs are an issue with this engine and can eventually damage the cylinder head and coil packs, leading to costly repairs. A second plug (passenger rear) was excessively tight when I removed it but the replacement plug appeared to thread back in fine. ) I believe this issue deserves further investigation. Thank you.

After a rainstorm is when we find the soaked carpeting on the passenger side of the car. The water seeps under the passenger seat where mold can form. The seats are difficult to remove and the area can't be vacuumed effectively. There seems to be either faulty harness plugs or another area in front tire flaps that the company didn't seal resulting in soaking wet carpets that can show signs of mold. I have very bad allergies and this is not acceptable. I also have my children, grandchildren and sometimes great grandchildren in this car and I'm afraid that any mold could compromise our health! why isn't Honda taking care of this issue when there are literally hundreds of complaints online concerning this issue? we have been having this issue for the last three years and it's getting ridiculous.

488,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Structure,Body problems,"We first noticed in oct. 2012 that the carpet and mat floor boards on both the front driver and passenger sides of our car were wet with water. It is now Dec. 2012 and the problem has worsened. The wet carpet is causing a mildew smell in our car which we cannot get rid of, as the carpets are getting wetter each time it rains. The car also fogs up constantly due to the inside moisture, making visibility extremely difficult. Once the temperature drops the wet floors are sure to freeze, thus causing another hazard: slippery feet near the break and accelerator. It is reasonable to suppose that there will be rust and eventual deterioration if the problem is not fixed. There seems to be a structural problem with the car on both sides where there is water dripping in from possibly the wheel well or right above the wheel well. In looking on line, we see several Honda Pilots and ridgelines with exactly the same problem, improper structural seals breaking down and causing water to drip onto the floorboards of the car. Honda is aware of the problem (we called our dealership) but will only fix it if the car is still under warranty. Seeing that this is a safety issue, and a known common structural problem with the car, it would seem to me that Honda should fix the problem.",  10/01/2012

The two nuts are tack welded directly to the thin body metal and apparently the repeated shock of closing the rear door can cause metal fatigue and the nuts to shear off with the body metal, resulting the license becoming unsecured to the vehicle. Potential safety hazard since if the owner does not notice the first failure, the metal fatigue will be accelerated by the additional torque stress and failure of the second nut could cccur while the car is in motion.

495,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Structure,Body problems,"I and my family have been loyal Honda owners since 1984. In those 25 years we have purchased 8 Honda automobiles. Until recently the service and support provided by Honda and its dealers has been exceptional. That was all until our most recent vehicle, a 2004 Honda Pilot. It is a vehicle my wife and I love but one that has had a high level of irritating small problems. The latest problem involves the mounting structure for the rear license plate. The metal holding the two welded on mounting nuts is so thin that after several years of vibrating the metal backing simply breaks away. In seeking a repair to the problem my local Honda dealer had no clue as to how to repair the problem and his only remedy was to send me to a local retail body shop for a $234. 00 repair. My local dealer indicates he was not able to obtain repair support from the factory because these problems are due to the use of heavy license plate holders. In response to that defense let me state the following:1. Research on the internet quickly reveals that the Honda Pilots have had this problem for several years. Dozens of Honda owners have had the same problem. 2. Honda regional representatives have accepted responsibility in some cases and not in others. 3. The heavy license plate frame being blamed is an item supplied by the dealer at time of purchase and does not represent an extra heavy burden. 4. The license plate has vibrated upon closing the rear hatch from day one of purchase. It is the nature of the design using only two mounting points. 5. The fact that the license plate and frame can suddenly fall from the vehicle and bounce into the following traffic represents a safety hazard which Honda should have warned owners of when they first discovered this problem.",  06/28/2009

498,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Structure,Body problems,"2004 Honda Pilot - purchased a brand new vehicle from the dealer that I am referring to in this complaint - the problem: a serious water leak problem on passenger side floor. It has gone through warranty work within first 10000 miles but the dealer could not find the water leakage problem after 8 hours of work in their body shop. The vehicle experiences a severe water leak problem in to the passenger floor every winter season (in pacific northwest, rainy season is the winter season) ever since the warranty work (that they could not find any root cause) was done in 2004. I recently called the same dealer and they said it is out of warranty and I need to pay a considerable deposit even for the dealer service department to take a look at something that they could not fix back in 2004 as a warranty work. With this serious interior water leak condition, the vehicle starts to smell bad inside and takes a lot of effort (my own time in every winter) to soak up water off the carpet floor inside of my Pilot every time it rained. I am not sure what the extend of the residual damage it may have on my vehicle that I cannot visibly see where the leak is coming into inside of the vehicle but it certainly will bring down the value of my Honda Pilot in case I want to trade or sell. This is totally unacceptable situation for the Honda Pilot owners to tolerate. I need to go out there and soak up more water out of my Pilot after I submit this complaint.",  09/15/2004

500,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,I bought this 2004 Honda Pilot new in 2004 in louisville. In 2018 I drove to florida without incident. While here in florida I have had a problem with oil leaking. Than the compressor for the air went out and I took it straight to the dealer here. They told me it was not worth fixing. Since then I have had 2 mechanics look underneath the car and said it was so rusted that the frame was dangerous and they could not risk fixing it. I have checked with other Honda owners only to find out this is a problem with numerous Honda years and no one fix this problems because of liability . I have photos of the rusted out rearend and the frame is not attached. You can find owners trying to weld the rearend back on. No one will repair my compressor because of the rust and damage. When I had it at the dealers they did not mention this problem at all. They just said it was not worth fixing. My car has about 200000 miles but has has its service. This has to be a major recall or replacement. We could have had a major accident over this and didnt know dena feima smith 9554 routt rd louisville ky 40299 502 645 1338.

501,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,Rinsing with water of the undercarriage after exposure to salted roads after snowfall (routine practice) I noticed flakes of rust beneath the rear of the vehicle. I crawled under the vehicle to observe extensive corrosion of the cross member that the rear suspension struts are attached to. The rear driver side area where the strut is connected is corroded to the extent where the mount is partially eaten away and a large hole has formed. The other strut mounting area is charting the same course and is substantially corroded. Should a strut disconnect from the vehicle a loss of control would occur. The approximate mileage of the vehicle is 107000. No other parts of vehicle appear to be corroded to a level approaching the rear. I will look at the front end to inspect more closely for corrosion damage and to take pictures. Vehicle was parked (stationary) when the corrosion was observed.,  02/17/2019
502,Honda,Pilot,2004 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"Rear suspension cross member support rusts out due to design. Over time water is thrown from tire and rests in the support nut area. Over time rust builds up and the support breaks through the rear cross member. No way for the water to escape. I am supplying one picture of my car showing where rust has started. Two additional pictures are from the shop fixing my car for another issue showing another customer with the same issue, but much worse. You cannot buy the cross member due to how the car is made. So the fix is to cut out the rust and weld in a new support. The car shop will rust proof and put a water resistant foam over the new support nut ensuring the rust will not return. My cost of this repair for both sides is just shy of $2000. My opinion is this is a factory design flaw that should be addressed by Honda. No recalls for this issue exist, and you are talking about the back end support potentially collapsing as you are driving. The issue was caught by the transmission shop doing other work on 12/18/2018. They just fixed the other customer's Pilot (2004) with the same issue (pictures I attached) and had the foresight to look at my 2004 Pilot. So for safety reasons I have no choice but to have them apply the same fix.",  12/18/2018

It is a michigan car so it has been exposed to road salt perhaps contributing to the rusting of the mounts. But, under no circumstance should this occur.

Typically it would occur as I was driving down steeper grades in the mountains. I brought this to the attention of the Honda dealer in April 2006 when the vehicle had 35,418 miles. The Honda dealer dismissed it and said it was probably due to the front wheel still wanting to provide power while the brakes were applied. Consequently, the brake system checked out fine during their inspection. Unfortunately, the problem still persists and is getting worse. I've also now noticed the problem when I drive on flatter surfaces as well. The problem is most noticeable when stopping at speeds over 50 mph and is even more pronounced when driving down hills.

681,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Air Bag,Air Bag problems,"First issue. Honda is failing to make proper notifications concerning recalls and extended warrantees. A warrantee extension notice for my 2009 Honda accord was forwarded to me by the person across town who received my notice. Last year the same person forwarded to me a takata airbag recall notice he received for my 2005 Honda Pilot. I purchased my 2005 Honda Pilot direct from Honda and my accord from a private owner. Both vehicles are in the Honda service data base with my correct name, address, and VIN. I have no connection to that address, and the resident there does not have my name or any Honda vehicles. I have spoken to Honda service and the Honda recall center about this. Yet, in March the same issue occurred with my 2009 Honda accord. Additionally, I have not received a notice on my 2010 Honda accord (purchased from a Honda dealer), which, according to the notice, is part of the class of vehicles subject to the same extended warrantee. Honda¿s national service center could not explain to me how the mistake occurred and could not assure me that their records would be corrected for purposes of safety notifications since Honda has had my information correct in their service center database. Second issue: my notice of an extended warrantee on 2008-2010 accords is for a corrosion issue with an internal component in the srs electronic control unit that could potentially result in srs failure. The notice stated that if the dashboard srs light alerts you to an issue, you need to bring the vehicle in for inspection ASAP. The srs light in my 2005 Honda Pilot illuminates intermittently. Honda said it is not covered, but they would diagnose it for $120/hr + repairs. For purposes of vehicle safety, can your office determine if the older Honda Pilots have the same srs ecu issue as the 2008-2010 Honda accord, and thus should be subject to a recall?.",  03/01/2016

The vehicle has the exact symptoms of the vsa recall, which was fixed on my vehicle. I purchased the car last year with very low miles, only drove for a few months before it started having issues. Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone. It is absolutely dangerous and even the dealer recommends it be fixed immediately, yet Honda has declared no fault.",  06/01/2020

If has also occurred at highway speed, but never associated with skidding, sliding, etc. The brakes appear to apply differentially, causing a swerve that needs to be corrected quickly to avoid collision with traffic. The vsa light comes on, and the triangular vsa disconnect light comes on. They both go out after the car is shut off and restarted. The local Honda dealer says there is no recall for this, but that they had reprogrammed the car's vsa during an earlier service visit.",  09/11/2019

Exactly the same thing happened after an hour or so. Engagement of abs was intermittent. As detailed in the attached document, we have take this to numerous Honda repair centers and the problem has persisted. We have experienced the spontaneous and intermittent engagement of abs only during long highway driving. In-between each repair, we have driven the car in the city nearly every day without any problems.

At the end of the day they still returned the vehicle with vsa light now asking to replace abs modulator at a cost of $1528. 03 plus taxes. I understand that there is a problem with Honda's vsa system and Honda fell short of the desired corrective action in the 2013 class action suite.

Huge safety issue and vehicle control was lost and vehicle slid and skidded into opposite lane of traffic. Warning lights vsa came on and vehicle drove like the emergency brake was engaged. Cleared after engine turned off, then happened the second time when getting on interstate in rush hour traffic. Car behind me had to turn towards ditch to avoid collision as I had no control over my vehicle. Drove to nearest dealer and they immediately saw the vsa light and warning symbol and said it was related to recall. Later changed their minds and said yaw rate sensor needs replaced at a total cost of $1150. Encouraged me to write to Honda for some relief in costs however that complaint fell on deaf ears. I have owned 5 Honda's and currently own 3 . They claim if they are not purchased new no customer has any loyalty based on their criteria. Seriously. . . . How do they think the Honda resale value is established and is so good !!!! very disappointment in the rude woman name caroline regional customer service rep in our area.

I have this occur daily. The vsa light and many times the tire pressure light immunimate just prior or at the time of the event. It is at the Honda dealer who first wanted me to replace the rear end but they say it is a faulty sensor and are replacing it for about $800 but they are still not sure that is the problem.

I had notified this vsa warning lite on ignition before the cold start in the morning to local dealer since last year. They said that they can't find any error code in diagnosis. In lately incident, they finally took the matter seriously then they found yaw sensor error code but they still can't guarantee the vsa problem will be solved.

719,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electronic Stability Control,Vsa Warning Light On problems,"Random, repeated and sudden breaks apply; car slows down dramatically. Vsa light may come on, may not. This occurred several times. The first time it occurred was on a trip to PA. The car would suddenly slow by more than 20 mph. We were thrown hard into our seat belts. We went to a Honda dealership in pittsburgh. They wanted to sell me 4 new tires stating the problem was due to tires not wearing even. This was hard for us to believe. It was extremely dangerous. We had to veer off the road many times to avoid accidents! google search on vsa car suddenly breaking - first 'hit' was a 2013 recall on the vsa harness and sensor. We received no information on the recall. Honda pittsburgh fixed the recall free. Then 8 weeks later in maryland the car began to do the same exact thing. We emergency stopped at a local auto center. Their system code showed faulty ""abs brake system"" they kindly reset the codes, but the car continued to exhibit same. We then went to salisbury, MD. Honda. They said we needed a new vsa module despite the diagnostic showing no codes stating we had a faulty vsa. The only vsa module was in ohio and would take a week to get to maryland, and cost us $1,710! all other vsa modules were on back order. We were on vacation and could not stay an additional week. Nor did it make sense to us to replace the vsa module when salisbury Honda said it was ""working as designed"". I have a legal formal complaint registered with Honda America. I urge you to do the same. Winston salem, nc Honda feels it is the yaw sensor. However, they have had my car for 5 days and are unable to duplicate the problem or show a code. I feel a recall should now be made for a yaw sensor. Better yet, Honda America should replace all vsa modules for free before someone is killed!! .",  05/19/2015

721,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electronic Stability Control,Vsa Warning Light On problems,"Sitting in a parking lot and the vsa light came on. Looked it up and saw the recall on the vsa so intended to get it checked out. A couple days later I'm tooling along at freeway speed and for a brief second it felt like someone slammed on the brakes and released, and the vsa light came on. Took it to the dealership and the codes they found were for some sort of a power drop and blamed it on a possible power outage or drop at some point. Maybe alternator, battery or something, but they didn't find anything wrong with any of those, but it cost me $125. 00 to be told they don't know. The vsa recall was completed in 2012 for the wiring harness. Today (a week later) I'm going about 25 on a surface street and the exact same thing happened, so I took it to the dealership without turning off the engine and possibly clearing any codes. What they came back with was a faulty yaw sensor code, but they want to keep it for a couple days to do further research. I'm told it is connected to the main computer and if it is the yaw sensor then the main computer has to be replaced, at a cost of $1650. 00 (they will credit toward the repair the $125. 00 I paid last week for the non-answer). In reading online, I'm not the only person who has had this issue. Also reading online a quick review seems to lead me to believe that the sensor can be replaced by itself, separate from the main computer, at a much lower cost.",  03/05/2015
722,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electronic Stability Control,Vsa Warning Light On problems,"My daughter was driving our family's 2005 Honda Pilot. She applied the brake lightly which resulted in excessive breaking in the left front wheel and then appearance of the vsa light. I brought the vehicle to the Honda dealer who first indicated there was no recall and then indicated there was a vsa wire harness recall (NHTSA 13v-092) but that it did apply the vsa light going on and therefore had nothing to do with the recall. A vsa light diagnostics which I independently paid for indicated a yaw rate failure code (25-01). This light vsa light has continued to intermittently go on and off with an intermittent contemporaneous relationship to braking. On 2/25/15 my daughter was driving the vehicle on the highway (no vsa light on), applied the brakes lightly and the car braked severly even once her foot was off the brake and pulled the car in the same front right direction as before forcing her to swerve along side a passing truck. The vsa light went on after the event occurred. Calling the Honda dealer today, the service manager indicated that Honda does not have a recall on this matter once the part for the 13v-092 recall was replaced. In reviewing safer car. Gov NHTSA campaign id number dp12002 it describes well what has occurred twice and which has not been corrected by the recall service performed. I have also contacted Honda USA. I believe Honda has inadequately evaluated the relationship of similarly reported events regarding unexpected car brake assist with mild application of the brake since the vsa wire harness recall repair did not resolve the unexpected and inappropriate vsa/esc/ba system logic response. It is not clear why Honda is not addressing my matter under this recall (NHTSA 13v-092) and the referenced NHTSA dp12002, and further investigating under a known safety recall.",  02/03/2015

This is our second safety complaint on this vehicle - 1st was dangerous ""phantom braking"" or inadvertant application on brakes in 2012, which Honda subsequently recalled in 2013. After reading thru complaints, I see the exact same problem - transmission line in radiator suddenly came loose and transmission fluid leaked into radiator and coolant leaked into transmission, ruining both has occurred numerous times. We anticipate a very expensive repair. . . .

738,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Engine And Engine Cooling,Radiator problems,"I had been driving for about 15 minutes when car suddenly failed to maintain speed and slowed from 45 mph to 30-35 mph. I could not get car to accelerate, engine was audibly strained and smoke was shortly evident from under hood. I put on my emergency flashers and pulled off the road as soon as it was safe to do so. No warning lights were illuminated. Smoke ceased when I turned the engine off. Upon exiting the car I observed a heavy stream of brown oily liquid draining from hood and additional blue oily fluid following shortly thereafter. I checked the fluid levels to find totally depleted transmission fluid and rapidly diminishing engine coolant. I called my Honda dealer service dept. And was advised not to drive the car and to have it towed to the service dept. Which I did. It was determined that a hose had disconnected and the radiator would need replacement. He could offer no explanation as to what caused the problem stating it had not seen it before. Total cost: $825. 00. Given the many internet complaints of this identical problem unreported to official agencies combined with those reported to Honda corporate and nhsta I am unconvinced that all Honda dealerships are unaware of this issue. I am, however, totally convinced that serious injury or death would have resulted had I been driving on a crowded highway at 70 mph when this hose disconnected causing an instantaneous loss of speed with impending engine failure. I am equally convinced that Honda corp. Is negligent in not admitting this to be a manufacturing defect worthy of a voluntary recall and financial reimbursement to it's customers. Nhsta is negligent in it's lack of attention to the serious nature of this problem and failure to mandate a recall.",  07/16/2014

My failure, of course, happened shortly after that extension. I am out nearly $5,000 and nearly got killed when my car died because Honda has failed to properly recall these transmissions.

Was not able to climb hill so I pulled over and turned the car off. Restarted and made it a short distance before it stopped. I was fortunate to get out of harm's way prior to the car giving out completely. The vehicle had to be towed. A mechanic took a look at the vehicle and explained that transmission and radiator were both ruined and would both need to be replaced. He indicated that transmission fluid and radiator fluid mixed causing the malfunction and it also has caused the need for flushing of the engine. I have noticed that several other owners have made internet posts about the same problem. This issue should be under consideration for a recall by Honda as it sounds like a common occurrence that is the result of a design flaw. It is potentially very dangerous as this happens with no warning and causes the vehicle to stop functioning. Obviously, this would be very dangerous if it occurs at highway speeds.

If this had happened on a busy freeway it would have been very dangerous. Upon doing an internet search I see that hundreds of 2005 Honda Pilots have suffered the same sudden failure of the exact same part causing the same condition. This usually results in damaging the transmission and costing thousands to repair. This is absolutely a safety hazard. Honda refuses to acknowledge that any problem exists. It is plainly evident that a manufacturing defect of this part exists. Any engineer who examines the data of hundreds and hundreds of accounts posted on the internet must come to the same conclusion. This is defective! this is dangerous! owners should be partially compensated for the expense of repair. Honda should be held accountable for a knowingly defective part.,  10/20/2013
746,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Engine And Engine Cooling,Radiator problems,"While driving along a rural 2 lane highway with no one behind me, the transmission appeared to slip and the engine rpm went way up. The truck slowed down. This lasted 3 or 4 seconds and then went back to normal. In a few minutes, I stopped at the light entering the village of saranac lake, NY. The 2005 Honda Pilot stopped running. I tried to restart and nothing happened at all. I put my flashers on and opened the hood. I saw a liquid that looked like chocolate milk leaking under the engine. After it was towed to a garage, the mechanic said he thought the radiator leaked and allowed the antifreeze to mix with the transmission fluid. The truck would need a new radiator and maybe a new trans and or engine. If someone had been behind me when this happened, it could have caused an accident because it caused the vehicle to slow down and the brake lights did not come on.

We were lucky to have cell phone service to call for a tow. I had my family, wife and two younger kids in the car. We waited for over 30 minutes for the tow truck to arrive, he had to call for transport for my family. We managed to find a service center that was willing stay open to fix our car. The car needed a new radiator and have the transmission flushed ($800), a valve broke sending coolant into the transmission. We learned that other 2005 Pilots had the same problem of which there was a recall for this issue on the 2004 Pilots, Honda would not do anything! (as a side note, I had some seat leather replaced and the color match was that of a 2004 Pilot). Since the day of the repair the transmission is very rough/bucking while shifting gears. To date, besides routine maintenance, oil changes and small parts, I have replaced the timing belt, starter, water pump, and the radiator. To have the transmission replaced would be a very costly repair. This was our family travel car and I now will only take the car around town for fear that the transmission will go. I was not in the market for a new car but due to this situation I need to get rid of this car!.",  08/24/2013
748,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Engine And Engine Cooling,Radiator problems,The transmission line that goes into the radiator was dislodged and all the transmission fluid leaked out as well as coolant. The car had been driven about 4 miles and was parked at the time of the incident. There was no visible damage to the transmission line or the radiator but both had to be replaced according to the Honda dealer. The cost of replacement was $641. 55 and none of this was covered by Honda. We believe that this is a serious defect in the Honda Pilot and is a major problem in both the Honda Pilot and odyssey van. This connection was not damaged and simply let loose. It has occurred in many other vehicles at different amounts of mileage from my vehicle. This connection should never come loose under normal driving conditions and is a serious defect with significant safety concerns. The repair person at the dealer told me that they are seeing a lot of these problems and that the line simply blows out under the pressure from inside the radiator (he said about 110 psi) Honda should be held responsible for this defect and all Honda Pilots and odyssey vans should be recalled and the defect corrected before serious injuries occur. We believe you should investigate this further and have Honda take corrective action. As I investigated this I determined that in some cases the coolant and radiator fluid mix together and cause serious damage to the transmission. This is caused by the same problem but the repair cost go into the thousands $ because of the damage to the transmission.,  07/13/2013

( and nothing on the street) the car was towed on a flatbed to my service center,which is a certified Honda service center. . Apparently there was a line failure that allowed antifreeze and transmission fluid to mix and go into the transmission. The radiator was replaced and coolant flushed. The transmission was flushed 6 times with 28 quarts of transmission fluid and after driving 16 miles I am aware that the tranny is compromised and am going back to flush again. My service man made it clear that there is no guarantee on the transmission. I am a woman who maintains her car diligently and could not have done anything to prevent this catastrophic failure and upon researching the problem, find other Honda owners experiencing the same thing.

Last Saturday, out of nowhere, it started to leak thick, pink liquid on our driveway. It appeared to me, and after looking at the owner's manual, that the issue was the radiator. It was a cold day so I started to drive to the dealer, watching the engine temperature light on the way. The car only went two miles before transmission stopped working. The car has now been at a local repair shop for a week and three days while I rent another vehicle. It is my understanding that this is a common issue in Pilot's after going over 100,000 miles (catastrophic radiator failure that leads to transmission failure). Honda should make certain that owners replace the radiator components that lead to this catastrophic failure before the owner has to replace both the radiator and the transmission. I would have certainly bought a new car if I had known this was coming up on the horizon, but now my investment in this vehicle will be too high to get rid of it.

767,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Engine And Engine Cooling,Radiator problems,"I had to replace my radiator at 37228 mileage and 85031 on 2005 Honda Pilot. The radiators are failing at the transmission fittings attached to the bottom of the radiators. There are several thousand complaints about this issue and Honda is denying there is a problem. The problem is the transmission cooler is built into the bottom of the radiator. The cooler sits in the bottom of the radiator. There are two transmission fittings on the out side of the radiator that attach to the transmission. This brings transmission fluid in the radiator cooler, cools the fluid and returns it to the transmission. Now inside the bottom radiator sits the transmission cooler which is just a small pipe witch is attached to the transmission fittings. When the fluid enters the radiator cooler it gets instantly cooled and returned to transmission because the cooler is submerged in radiator fluid. This is because the bottom of the radiator is the coolest at the bottom. What's happening is the transmission fittings are rusting away and failing allowing radiator fluid to enter the return line to the transmission. When radiator fluid enters the transmission the transmission is done. You need a replacement. These problem is happening to several Hondas and nissin. The two car company's use the same manufacturing for the radiator. The company is dense. The failing on Hondas and Nissan. If you look into this matter you will see how many people are affected by this. I replaced two radiators for this truck so far. Please look into this problem for $1400 so far.

770,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electrical System,Electrical System problems,"2005 Pilot was repaired under vsa recall in 2013. As of the last couple of weeks, again I experienced same exact vehicle safety issues prior to repair. This past week while I had my three children in the car, we almost lost our lives. A semi driver instead risked his own lives to keep from slamming in the back of us. We took our Pilot to Honda dealership that has serviced our vehicle over the years and they do not want to recognize issue and instead point to the same thing I am now reading here online. The dealership service department states it is the yaw sensor as the issue, not faulty repair. It is not a coincidence that Pilot owners are now once again are experiencing the same issues all over again. How many lives will be lost or changed for the worst before Honda is forced to reckon with this issue? this is wrong and unacceptable. There are other poor design flaws that we think also may have cost us so much more money, such as the vvt issues. However, the vsa repair issue is not something that can be overlooked and must be dealt with now. Specifically, my experience mostly on flat surfaces with exception of one time on a slight incline at a stop light. Both in town driving and intersate and all dry weather conditions except one occasion. The vsa light flashed, vehicle applied brake at without my foot on brake pedal. My foot was on accelerator at the time vehicle was being harshly stopped by the brakes applied. This caused the vehicle to make a bucking motion or jerking motion, also I've experienced the slight swerve. I was driving in a straight direction all of the times this occurred since the repair in 2013. It depended on the amount of pressure and length of time the vehicle acted up. Everything is just as it did prior to the repair in 2013, nothing is any different, all the same. Yet, Honda wants to say I need to cover repair.",  11/04/2020

The vehicle has the exact symptoms of the vsa recall, which was fixed on my vehicle. I purchased the car last year with very low miles, only drove for a few months before it started having issues. Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone.

Additionally, I have not received a notice on my 2010 Honda accord (purchased from a Honda dealer), which, according to the notice, is part of the class of vehicles subject to the same extended warrantee. Honda¿s national service center could not explain to me how the mistake occurred and could not assure me that their records would be corrected for purposes of safety notifications since Honda has had my information correct in their service center database. Second issue: my notice of an extended warrantee on 2008-2010 accords is for a corrosion issue with an internal component in the srs electronic control unit that could potentially result in srs failure. The notice stated that if the dashboard srs light alerts you to an issue, you need to bring the vehicle in for inspection ASAP. The srs light in my 2005 Honda Pilot illuminates intermittently. Honda said it is not covered, but they would diagnose it for $120/hr + repairs. For purposes of vehicle safety, can your office determine if the older Honda Pilots have the same srs ecu issue as the 2008-2010 Honda accord, and thus should be subject to a recall?.",  03/01/2016

782,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electrical System,Electrical System problems,"My daughter was driving our family's 2005 Honda Pilot. She applied the brake lightly which resulted in excessive breaking in the left front wheel and then appearance of the vsa light. I brought the vehicle to the Honda dealer who first indicated there was no recall and then indicated there was a vsa wire harness recall (NHTSA 13v-092) but that it did apply the vsa light going on and therefore had nothing to do with the recall. A vsa light diagnostics which I independently paid for indicated a yaw rate failure code (25-01). This light vsa light has continued to intermittently go on and off with an intermittent contemporaneous relationship to braking. On 2/25/15 my daughter was driving the vehicle on the highway (no vsa light on), applied the brakes lightly and the car braked severly even once her foot was off the brake and pulled the car in the same front right direction as before forcing her to swerve along side a passing truck. The vsa light went on after the event occurred. Calling the Honda dealer today, the service manager indicated that Honda does not have a recall on this matter once the part for the 13v-092 recall was replaced. In reviewing safer car. Gov NHTSA campaign id number dp12002 it describes well what has occurred twice and which has not been corrected by the recall service performed. I have also contacted Honda USA. I believe Honda has inadequately evaluated the relationship of similarly reported events regarding unexpected car brake assist with mild application of the brake since the vsa wire harness recall repair did not resolve the unexpected and inappropriate vsa/esc/ba system logic response. It is not clear why Honda is not addressing my matter under this recall (NHTSA 13v-092) and the referenced NHTSA dp12002, and further investigating under a known safety recall.",  02/03/2015

I am reporting, because I realize this needed to be reported. It is a safety issue. This loss of electrical power has occurred with the original battery, as well as two other batteries over the life of the car. It appears to be electrically related.

When I got to work I looked into my owner's manual which informed there may be a problem with the transmission and I should take the vehicle to the Honda dealership. When I took the vehicle to the dealership where I mind you I just spent almost $700. 00 on 6/15/2013 for suspension maintenance informed that this issue is very popular with the Honda Pilots and it's most likely my 4th gear pressure switch for the transmission. They then informed me that it will cost $350. 00 to replace this part. When I previously looked up the part needed and how to possibly diy; I found that the part only cost between $34. 00 and $40. 00 and a beginner can change this part in about 45 minutes to an hour. So why is the dealership charging me $350. 00 to change a part that cost $34. 00 - $40. 00 and an hour labor; does technician make $310. 00 an hour these days?! Honda USA knows that they have a defective part on the Honda Pilots and refuse to conduct a recall because they rather cheat their customers than have a smaller bonus! there are articles on-line of drivers transmissions locking up because of this issue which is extremely dangerous; Honda and all other automotive makers need to be held accountable for all faulty parts within their product just any other company.",  06/17/2013
790,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Electrical System,Electrical System problems,"This incident has happened on a few occasions with me driving the vehicle and additionally with my wife driving (she drives it the most). I started the vehicle, placed it in gear and started to drive it up the street. As I approached a traffic light, I glanced at the speedometer, and noticed the maintenance required and srs light on. This puzzled me because we never experienced any issues with the vehicle other than regular maintenance lights (filters, oil change, etc). I turned the vehicle off for a few seconds, restarted it and the light went out. Afew weeks later, it happened again. The difference was that this time I noticed it right after putting the vehicle in drive and driving off. Thinking it happened because of a possible glitch in the ignition, I immediately pulled over and turned the vehicle off and restarted it. Just like the first time, the light didn't come back on. The 3rd time it happened, it remained on the entire time I drove and to and from the grocery store. Now, it pretty much does it intermittently - cycling intermittent to steady at various times. After searching online for recalls, I read several complaints from drivers in various states (USA), they are experiencing the same problem and have voiced it to Honda but they haven't issued a recall; thus stating that the airbag may not deploy during an accident and they are not responsible. Instead Honda dealers are willing to charge approx. $120 for diagnostics and $300+ for repair - which is entirely unfair to us consumers. However Honda, issued a recall on the 2005 Honda odyssey which had very similar (if not exact) problems with its srs. Honda is aware of this issue and doesn't seem to care about the safety of the motorists. This is clearly a safety issue and need to be recalled on these vehicles.",  06/12/2013

Transmission light also intermittently lights (blinking d). I had this fixed years ago after the dealer said new trans for $3,000. I didn't bite on that one because the shifting was seemless.

Westbound and grant rd. Cypress TX 77429 previous owners of Honda crv, we love theirs cars we thought it was just bad luck, things that happen, we moved on. Since then she/complained/brakes will disengaged and engage again. The car will stop but a couple of feet longer that intended. 1st. Time I replace brake pads, 2nd. Time I tried to replicate the experience but no luck. 3rd. Time new brake fluid and complete brake inspection. 12/2012 she told me again.

There was a knocking noise in the rear right passenger side. I had the shocks changed and was advised that the entire frame is rusted out. I did not notice the rust but my mechanic pointed it out to me and now I do not feel safe driving this car. Before I was advised of the rust damage I put all new brakes and tires. Im in six thousand on the car and now I have to scrap it. This seems like an issue that Honda should take responsibility for. How can the frame, chasis, and sub frame rot/rust out. This is not okay.

Upon visual inspection of the rear wheel speed sensors, wires, and connectors, I discovered that the rear two sub frame mounts had separated from the chassis, causing the rear portion of the sub frame assembly to drop 5-6 inches, which resulted in the rear wheel speed sensor wires getting pulled from their connectors.

I told the Honda dealer that I think Honda corporation should do a recall on the motor mounts because all Pilot owners are complaining about the same issues. I still have the shaking in the steering wheel and I'm afraid that I might have to replace the third motor mount to resolve the shaking in the steering wheel.

843,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"I recently purchased an '05 Honda Pilot from butler pre-owned dealership in butler, PA. The vehicle was leased for 3 years, and I worked the deal on the car on the internet. When a price was agreed to, I drove to butler to pick up the vehicle, however, I test drove it first. It had a very noticeable shimmy, and a shudder when driving at 50mph speeds and up. I told the salesman that this was unacceptable, so we returned to the dealership, and drove 3 other '05 Pilots on the lot, all with the same problem. The salesman and sales manager said this was a result of putting new tires on all of these vehicles, and after driving the vehicle for a while, the ride would smooth out. Well, I swallowed this line of crap, hook, line, and sinker, and after returning home, and driving the Pilot for a couple weeks, I replaced the new kumho tires with oem goodyear integrity tires, and had the wheels balanced twice, once at Honda dealer, and again at local tire shop, with latest state of the art balancing machines. After all this, the shimmering and shuddering is still as bad as it was when I brought the vehicle home, and I cannot drive this thing at highway speeds. After much research on the internet lately, I have found literally thousands of complaints from Pilot owners with the same problem that I am having. I paid $16500 for this vehicle, and can't even drive it out of town, and I'm not going to sit still and accept this as my fate. First, at the very least, the dealer mis-represented this vehicle, and I should have some recourse in this respect. Second, Honda has obviously put out a defective product, which they should be willing to fix, or compensate the victims of this type of fraudulent product. I was very happy at the prospect of purchasing a quality vehicle, which my wife and family could enjoy for years to come, and felt justified in spending the money to do so. However, I now feel sick at the prospect of paying for this mistake for the next 6 years. Please help!.",  11/13/2008

Owner had an independent tire dealer check and re-balance the wheels as needed. Vibration remained. 2 more visits to dealer who advised no problem found and go see the goodyear dealer, who wanted no part of this issue. More trips to dealer who advised the vehicle owner should consider replacing the oem tires (now at only 8,500 miles). Owner replaced oem tires with michelin ltx m/s ($700) and vibration remains. Dealer re-balanced tires on hunter 9700 machine resulting in minor improvement but basic jitter remains. Next visit the deal acknowledges jitter, it's annoyance, and blames tread pattern on the now non-oem tires. Filed complaint with Honda north America and waited 312 business hours for a return call. Honda responded when I mentioned arbitration. Honda north America reports the dealer said 'no problem found'. Now at 14,000 miles. Honda says they have no regional rep covering my area (4th largest metropolitan area in the us) and will call me back, soon. The vehicle jitter remains, 65 mph and higher, making the vehicle tiring to drive on trips of distance (vacation travel). The jitter/vibration is distracting and over rides standard 'road feel'.

The recall work was done with the capacitor added to the circuit to smooth the signal and the ground connection under the driver side kick panel was cleaned according to the TSB, however, based on my experience and what has been reported by numerous other Honda Pilot owners this cheaper fix to replacing or repairing the yaw sensing circuit is concerning, particularly since Honda charges nearly $1000 for an oem yaw sensor.",  03/20/2022

Replaced both front speed sensors, but the issue occurred on the interstate drive home immediately after. Hope to be able to drop the vehicle off for an extended period once I take delivery on my new vehicle. Worried the issue will occur in rain or snow & be even more dangerous. Repair shop ran diagnostic showing the yaw issue, but said the Honda generated code report only went up to 25 mph.

And looking closer I saw a bolt or whatever its called that holds the frame cradle rusted off and separated from the main frame also the right side looks very rusted and concerned it could separate as well and the whole rear frame suspension could drop.

It seems as is this problem is endemic and the product of a design flaw or a case planned obsolescence. It is not credible that Honda will not own up to its mistakes . I suppose since no one has been killed by the engine mount failures Honda feels secure. I could find no examples of fatal accidents occurring because of this defect, but perhaps your resources are greater than mine.

863,Honda,Pilot,2005 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"I experienced a sudden involuntary unintended acceleration, while I was slowly pulling into a perpendicular parking space in at a medical center parking lot. This happened on a nearly empty tank of gas at about 3:15 pm on Saturday 4/16/16. It was a hot day. The parking space was at a slight incline. I was moving very slowly nearly stopped, yet once I was about a third of the way into the space, while still gently breaking, my car suddenly lurched forward with tremendous force if I had completely floored the gas pedal. I reacted fast pushed the breaks hard with all my strength. Which engaged the antilock braking so I heard a ""thud-thud thud"" a loud repeated clunking-locking sound. My Pilot did stop before hitting a tree and the vehicle in the facing parking space. I did not hear the engine rev to the degree of the sudden forward motion. Nor did I hear revving resolve once it stopped. It was a very odd and frightening experience that baffled my mind. I tried to sort out the cause for a while to see if maybe I had without knowing it put my foot on both pedals. But I don't think so. I had sandals on, and in trying to reproduce the situation, or the position my foot would have to have been in to do that, was awkward and I would have felt the pressure on my foot of putting on the gas. And I was only slowly pressing the break not jamming on the break ¿ until I braked to stop the speed of it lurching forward. The degree of acceleration was as if the gas pedal was put to the floor which was not what my breaking foot was doing. The car did come to a stop just in time to not hit what was at the front of the parking space. I did not hear the engine noise rev at all. My best guess at the time was something went terribly wrong with the mechanics or electrical signals of the fuel injection to move so suddenly forward. Now I am worried about the safety of this vehicle.",  04/16/2016

I was able to properly secure the tailgate latch to the door and restore proper functionality. I believe that more locks will reveal to be improperly secured from the factory. My vehicle has never been rear ended or had any post factory repairs.

I could not get car to accelerate, engine was audibly strained and smoke was shortly evident from under hood. I put on my emergency flashers and pulled off the road as soon as it was safe to do so. No warning lights were illuminated. Smoke ceased when I turned the engine off. Upon exiting the car I observed a heavy stream of brown oily liquid draining from hood and additional blue oily fluid following shortly thereafter. I checked the fluid levels to find totally depleted transmission fluid and rapidly diminishing engine coolant. I called my Honda dealer service dept. And was advised not to drive the car and to have it towed to the service dept. Which I did. It was determined that a hose had disconnected and the radiator would need replacement. He could offer no explanation as to what caused the problem stating it had not seen it before. Total cost: $825. 00. Given the many internet complaints of this identical problem unreported to official agencies combined with those reported to Honda corporate and nhsta I am unconvinced that all Honda dealerships are unaware of this issue. I am, however, totally convinced that serious injury or death would have resulted had I been driving on a crowded highway at 70 mph when this hose disconnected causing an instantaneous loss of speed with impending engine failure. I am equally convinced that Honda corp. Is negligent in not admitting this to be a manufacturing defect worthy of a voluntary recall and financial reimbursement to it's customers.

There was no visible damage to the transmission line or the radiator but both had to be replaced according to the Honda dealer. The cost of replacement was $641. 55 and none of this was covered by Honda. We believe that this is a serious defect in the Honda Pilot and is a major problem in both the Honda Pilot and odyssey van. This connection was not damaged and simply let loose. It has occurred in many other vehicles at different amounts of mileage from my vehicle. This connection should never come loose under normal driving conditions and is a serious defect with significant safety concerns. The repair person at the dealer told me that they are seeing a lot of these problems and that the line simply blows out under the pressure from inside the radiator (he said about 110 psi) Honda should be held responsible for this defect and all Honda Pilots and odyssey vans should be recalled and the defect corrected before serious injuries occur. We believe you should investigate this further and have Honda take corrective action. As I investigated this I determined that in some cases the coolant and radiator fluid mix together and cause serious damage to the transmission. This is caused by the same problem but the repair cost go into the thousands $ because of the damage to the transmission.,  07/13/2013

Replaced both front speed sensors, but the issue occurred on the interstate drive home immediately after. Hope to be able to drop the vehicle off for an extended period once I take delivery on my new vehicle. Worried the issue will occur in rain or snow & be even more dangerous. Repair shop ran diagnostic showing the yaw issue, but said the Honda generated code report only went up to 25 mph.

When this stops, the vsa light is on as well as a yellow triangle with an exclamation point. When the dealer 'fixed' this in June, they repaired a tpms sensor. They also found a brake caliper stuck and fixed that as well as replaced the brake pads. Since June the issue has not occurred until yesterday. It has happened at 3 times in the past 2 days, all at @ 45 mph. This seems to be a widely reported issue and is certainly a safety concern.

I've finally gotten around to filing an official report both with Honda and NHTSA to hopefully aid in the investigation. The braking issue happened on two separate occasions on the same day, roughly 2 months ago. The first incident happened on the freeway. I was going the speed limit when all of a sudden I felt like the car completely lost power. The lights on the dashboard flashed, my speed decreased suddenly although I still had my foot on the gas. It only last a few seconds and then I regained control of the vehicle. An hour later, when I was off the freeway, it happened again, but this time I was going 25 miles an hour driving on city streets. Same exact issue where it felt like the car computer shut down with no power for a few seconds. It hasn't happened since, but I'm very scared that it may happen at any time again.

During this time the lights on the dashboard go out and flash and there is a popping sound at times. The last time it happened there was loss of all electrical to dash board system including the radio. The radio needed the code reentered which is normal for when all battery power is lost to the vehicle. I had this checked by a mechanic and they were unable to locate any problems. They checked the alternator, battery, connections and the system for any errors and nothing can be found. This is consistent with all other complaints associated with the esa, vsa/vsc and electrical systems as reported on this forum. I believe there is a major and dangerous bug in the system causing the car to loose power and control and any rate of speed. I also informed Honda customer service but they said that they are unaware of any problems (or I should say owning up to any of thier problems) and to issue a complaint through this forum. I'm afaid it's going to take a major accident and a loss of life, which is bound to happen based on the fact that the car comes to an abrupt halt, in order for Honda to own up to thier responsibility of spending the effort to identify this problem and issue a recall and get this fixed.

Check your plugs and coils just wanted to get the word spread around there is a serious issue with the Honda 3. 5 v6 engine which can lead to serious damage to the cylinder head and possibly the entire engine. I didn't learn of this until recently, when the spark plug in the #5 cylinder shot out of the head and destroyed the coil, and trashed the threads. I found a bunch of different people this has happened to, and all of the results aren't good. The extended warranty which was through Honda care denied my claim because they said it was damage from the spark plug and they don't cover spark plugs. What a load. If they want to play that game, what the heck would they ever have to cover? sorry sir, there's a short in your electrical system but it's because of the insulation in the wires and we don't cover damage from the insulation. . . Grrrrrr. . . So I called Honda and we'll see if they can do something for us as loyal Honda customers - I even mentioned that we've got a Honda crv. . . Sigh. . .

As everyone describes after one mile of driving the vsa will come on if you attempt to accelerate when on it will engage the brakes but not fully so it shutters and rpm soar but you go no where causing daily near miss accidents. Honda dealers acknowledge this module is the issue but due to the 2006 not being on the govt recall list they will not repair or replace you have to pay to have it done at a cost of 1650. 00. The Honda mechanic showed me the whitepaper Honda has on how to replace this module and the issue it creates but unwilling to stand behind repairing it for free only offer a 125. 00 discount on the repair. So im clear 1. Vsa light comes on stays on and vsa switch will not turn this function off as it is designed to. 2. When you attempt to make rapid acceleration the vehicle will not respond just shutters. 3. You have to make a slow smooth acceleration up to your desired speed. 4.

It almost came to a complete stop but I was at a major intersection and had no choice but to try and keep driving to avoid getting hit. I somehow managed to get it turned but it didn't want to speed up when I tried to accelerate. I managed to get into a parking lot and turned it off. I let it sit for a few minutes as we caught our breath (two of my kids were with me and it had scared them too) and then cranked it up again. The vsa light was gone but when I put it in reverse to see what it would do, it wouldn't move. It was like the parking brake was on. I then realized that's what it seemed like as I was driving when it happened. I'd thought the car wasn't wanting to run but it was like the brakes were on. Anyway, the brake pedal was stiff and I couldn't push it at all. I tried pumping the pedal to see if it would release but even though I could put the car in either park or drive, it wouldn't move. It was like the parking brake was on or I was holding the brake, neither of which was true. I called a nearby shop and two technicians came to where we were. They cranked it up and everything seemed okay but it was taken back to the shop where they ran every test possible and drove it three different times but nothing happened. They're perplexed as to what's wrong. I came home and got online only to find that there are tons of postings online about the exact same thing happening to others but only the 2005 Pilot has been recalled. Honda, I love my Pilot and don't want to get rid of it nor do I not want to buy another one when the time comes. But, I'm not putting my kids' lives in danger nor my life in danger to drive the car I love.

My foot was not even on the brake pedal, thank god no one was behind me. I had no idea why that had just happened. So I went online to research what the vsa system, not thinking the braking had anything to do with the vsa system, then I come across a Honda forum and find out this has happened to alot of other Pilot owners, and that the braking is connected to the vsa system. This is a dangerous hazard and should be addressed ASAP before someone gets killed. Unfortunately alot of people tailgate and if this were to have happened on the freeway it could have been deadly. I will also be writing a letter to Honda to see if there any kind of recourse for us Pilot owners.",  03/13/2012
1018,Honda,Pilot,2006 Pilot,Service Brakes,Service Brakes problems,"I have a 2006 Honda Pilot which I believe has a similar problem as toyotas recent recalls about sticky acceleration. I am the first owner of this SUV and noticed the problem during the very first year itself. That time my vehicle failed to stop on a stop sign. The problem I faced was when I applied brake, the car didn't stop and it continued in the acceleration mode and finally stopped after crossing the stop sign. I had reported this problem immediately to the Honda dealer, from where I purchased the vehicle. They inspected the vehicle and returned to me saying that they didn't find any problem. In fact they laughed at me that I didn't apply the brake properly. The dealer didnt document my concern. After that till now (almost 4 years) I am experiencing this kind of problem quite often. Because of this problem, I have to always make sure to brake an additional 2 or 3 feet ahead of my proposed stop as the vehicle may not stop where I think it should stop. If it does not stop, I brake harder and at that time I hear the acceleration is still on. I always ignored this problem mainly because this happens quite randomly like maybe a couple of times every month. I have not been able to figure out what exactly triggers this. Recently after reading about the Toyota recall, I have a feeling that my vehicle also has the similar problems and I notified the american Honda company. They actually didn't show much interest in addressing my problem mainly because my vehicle already has 52k miles and the warranty period (60k miles) will end soon.

The vehicle comes to a very abrupt stop, and I am no longer able to drive. The only way I am able to drive the vehicle is by dissableing the vsa system completely. Luckily it has only happened once while driving at highway speeds. I am very worried to drive my vehicle with my children in the car due to just simply not knowing when it will happen again. I have taken the Pilot into my local Honda dealership and they can not diagnose the problem. I have seen a recall on the 2005 model and all symptoms sound the same as the issues my 2006 Pilot is having. In doing some research online it sounds as though Honda is simply ignoring the issue to avoid there own personal loss. This issue is not a minor one I feel my as well as my families lives are in danger while driving my vehicle.",  12/01/2016

1027,Honda,Pilot,2006 Pilot,Electronic Stability Control,Vsa Warning Light On problems,"I had just started slowing down to turn at a stop light when the vsa warning light came on and my car became hard to steer. It almost came to a complete stop but I was at a major intersection and had no choice but to try and keep driving to avoid getting hit. I somehow managed to get it turned but it didn't want to speed up when I tried to accelerate. I managed to get into a parking lot and turned it off. I let it sit for a few minutes as we caught our breath (two of my kids were with me and it had scared them too) and then cranked it up again. The vsa light was gone but when I put it in reverse to see what it would do, it wouldn't move. It was like the parking brake was on. I then realized that's what it seemed like as I was driving when it happened. I'd thought the car wasn't wanting to run but it was like the brakes were on. Anyway, the brake pedal was stiff and I couldn't push it at all. I tried pumping the pedal to see if it would release but even though I could put the car in either park or drive, it wouldn't move. It was like the parking brake was on or I was holding the brake, neither of which was true. I called a nearby shop and two technicians came to where we were. They cranked it up and everything seemed okay but it was taken back to the shop where they ran every test possible and drove it three different times but nothing happened. They're perplexed as to what's wrong. I came home and got online only to find that there are tons of postings online about the exact same thing happening to others but only the 2005 Pilot has been recalled. Honda, I love my Pilot and don't want to get rid of it nor do I not want to buy another one when the time comes. But, I'm not putting my kids' lives in danger nor my life in danger to drive the car I love. Please, please, please consider recalling the 2006 models as well since there's definitely a problem with them too.",  12/26/2014

Both rear suspension mounts had catastrophically failed pulling completely out of the subframe. The subframe crossmember and a number of components were found to be heavily rusted and severely structurally compromised. We had planned to drive about 80 (predominantly freeway) miles each way that day to visit family for the holiday. It is a small miracle that these failed in the driveway and not on the freeway at 70 miles per hour.

Several warning lights lit up in the dashboard, there was a loud exhaust leak, and the car was no longer accelerating. There was an auto care center 50 yards away so I slowly drove it there for an inspection. The mechanic lifted the vehicle and showed me that the back two rear subframe mounts were detached from the body which made the car inoperable. There was no visible rust on the undercarriage; the subframe mounts rusted from the inside out. My insurance company would not cover the damage as it was a rust issue. The car was irreparable so I had to total the car and received 10% of what the car was worth running from the junk yard. I purchased the Pilot new in Feb. 2006 and performed all the recommended Honda maintenance. I personal performed all oil and break jobs so I was familiar with the undercarriage of the car. I did not see any rust under the car that would have alerted me there was a potentially dangerous issue with the rear subframe. A google search turned up several other Honda Pilots of this generation having the same subframe rust as mine with the same catastrophic failure of the rear mounts.

The actual mechanism on the rear hatch has become disconnected from the frame and is able to move freely about. This causes the rear hatch to not latch, latch partially, or latch but still allow the rear hatch to slightly move. The latching mechanism is only being held in place (in a confined area) by the plastic paneling of the car. Since the latch is no longer attached to the frame, the movement of the mechanism determines if the rear hatch is going to latch or not. When it is latched, the only item securing the mechanism is the plastic paneling. The mechanism itself is not defective or broken however; the way the mechanism has been secured seems to be the issue.

1075,Honda,Pilot,2006 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"I started to notice the rear of my vehicle making clunking noise and occasional metal on metal ticking noises at lower speeds and over bumps. I just assumed my rear shocks were going out. I then later realize the rear of my vehicle is sitting a lot lower especially the driver side. About a week later I took my car in for brakes and while on the hoist lifted up I see that both of the 'trailing arms"" right/left sides have completely detached from the sub frame. Now knowing the real issue at hand and doing my share of research online this doesn't seem to be addressed by the manufacture at all, possibly knowing the potential of having one of the main components for keeping your rear axle intact with the whole vehicle fail that easily!!!.",  09/21/2019
1076,Honda,Pilot,2006 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"While recently driving my 2006 Honda Pilot on the highway, the vehicle seemed a little unsteady when cornering. After arriving home, the rear suspension looked too low and the negative camber of the rear wheels looked excessive. Closer inspection revealed the rear frame crossmember had extreme internal corrosion and both rear suspension mounting bolts had completely broken away from the frame (see included photos). The rear suspension had dropped several inches below the original mounting position and was pressing on the exhaust system. I question the safety of driving the vehicle in this condition and possibly has been and is an accident waiting to happen. Overall, the rest of the vehicle is in really good shape, has been well maintained, never been driven off-road or in harsh conditions and has never pulled heavy loads. The internal frame corrossion seems excessive for a vehicle of this age and perhaps the result of poor design, poor quality and/or inadequate corrosion protection. My local Honda dealer says this problem is unknown to them, is not fixable and there was nothing they can do at this time but refer me to Honda national. Honda national also initially claimed no knowledge of this problem even though numerous identical problems can be found on the NHTSA website as well as other online sources. A complaint and case number has now been registered with Honda for this problem. Unfortunately, this once great vehicle appears to be prematurely destined for the scrap metal pile. Very sad outcome for any modern vehicle and especially one with the reputation for quality and reliability of a Honda vehicle.",  06/05/2019
1077,Honda,Pilot,2006 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"2006 Honda Pilot ex mileage: 144,309 I was accelerating from a stop when I felt a jolt coming from the rear of the car. Several warning lights lit up in the dashboard, there was a loud exhaust leak, and the car was no longer accelerating. There was an auto care center 50 yards away so I slowly drove it there for an inspection. The mechanic lifted the vehicle and showed me that the back two rear subframe mounts were detached from the body which made the car inoperable. There was no visible rust on the undercarriage; the subframe mounts rusted from the inside out. My insurance company would not cover the damage as it was a rust issue. The car was irreparable so I had to total the car and received 10% of what the car was worth running from the junk yard. I purchased the Pilot new in Feb. 2006 and performed all the recommended Honda maintenance. I personal performed all oil and break jobs so I was familiar with the undercarriage of the car. I did not see any rust under the car that would have alerted me there was a potentially dangerous issue with the rear subframe. A google search turned up several other Honda Pilots of this generation having the same subframe rust as mine with the same catastrophic failure of the rear mounts. I believe that this is a manufacturing defect in that water was allowed to pool between the layers of steel in the unibody. The car had 144,309 miles on it and was mechanically in great condition until I had this issue.",  04/14/2019

It turns out that the rear subframe, suspension, and drive train had fallen out of the rear crossmember. This is due to premature rust and inadequate metal used in the rear subframe. The rear subframe and suspension is only being held in with 2 more rusty bolts. This vehicle is not rusty anywhere else and is in excellent condition. It does have 165,000 miles on it. The vehicle is no longer safe to drive . I hate to think what would have happened at 70 mph on the highway with my family. This is a serious safety issue and needs to be addressed immediately. The certified Honda dealer that I took it too says they can't fix it, and the vehicle is junk. The vehicle is in excellent condition in every other aspect.

On Sunday, February 28, 2010 near our home on key biscayne, florida. We were driving at around 20 mph and as we gently braked in approach of the stop sign, the engine opened up nearly full throttle at just above 5000 rpms. My husband immediately and firmly applied the brake and placed the gear in park. With his foot on the brake, not the accelerator pedal, the engine continued to roar at 5000 rpms until he turned it off at the ignition after about 30 seconds. He restarted the engine and the engine rpm immediately shot up to 5000 rpms again, with his foot on the brake and the car in park. The tachometer stayed at the 5000 rpm level continuously until he again turned off the engine at the ignition after about 45 seconds. We waited a few more seconds and re-started the engine again. That time, the engine started at a normal rpm and we drove half a block to our house. We recorded a video of the second episode of 5000 rpms with a camera we had with us. We provided the video immediately to american Honda customer service. At the request of customer service, I took our Pilot to brickell Honda in miami on March 1. I showed the video of the sua to the service manager, george ruiz, on his computer. He was astounded by what he saw and expressed his genuine concern that the car was unsafe to operate, regardless of whether his service department was able to find the source of the problem. He said under no circumstance should the engine operate at 5000 rpms without the accelerator being depressed almost all the way to the floor. The district service manager, kevin mcclung, also inspected the car. American Honda determined the Pilot was operating within normal parameters. We were instructed to pick up the car on March 5 and did so on March 8. No repairs were performed.

As I took my foot off the brake and stepped on the gas, the car rolled backward several feet, and front tires kept spinning loosing traction, and the back of the car had a fish tail motion. I tested the car on a flat surface in the rain, and the front tire spinning still occurs. I tested the car on the same incline during dry road conditions, and the car rolls back once you take your foot off the brake. Took it into the dealership and took the mechanic for a test drive, he says the new 2006 Honda Pilots are all experience the same roll back and traction problems. Spoke with Honda's regional case manager on 3/6/06, his recommendations were to trade the car in for a 4 wd Pilot or learn to drive with both feet, your left on the brake and right foot on the gas so to ease the car and prevent roll back and loss of tire traction. They would report it to the Honda engineers, but I had no other options. I feel this is an extremely dangerous safety situation for me.

This time, the service manager himself took care of us. He used a heat gun to attempt to melt the cover back into the proper shape, replaced the clips and assured us that this would be a permanent fix. Because we were not confident with the fix, we contacted Honda America and took out a case number (05085702). Honda America's only comment was that we needed to work through the dealership. A month later, the seat back cover came off again while in the garage. We again contacted Honda America to inform them and to follow-up on our case.

How can you blame other countries for trying to kill americans when it is happening within our own country-how can someone sleep at night knowing so many people are driving unsafe vehicles. 1 life is too many, how many other lives are you willing to risk before you make them do something so people are safe.

Honda & michelin are not set up to provide the consumer with service/accessibility to maintain this tire. I feel Honda should have informed about the problems associated with this product and given me a choice. I would not have purchased a car with these tires. I have 3 small children and now have to be concerned about getting a flat tire in a remote location, and fear for our personal safety. I choose now to only travel near major cities. Honda said I would need new rims & tires. . . And they do not seem to want to help. I am hoping you can provide me with a contact or give me some info on how to get these tires off my vehicle. Also shouldn't Honda be willing to replace a product that has issues associated with it. When I had my flat tire I took my car to 3 tire shops and was told they would not touch the pax-tire & they had no plans on acquiring the equipment to fix them because it was too expensive and not enough vehicles have the tire system to make it cost effective. Honda first needs to better inform the consumer what they are getting into and the issues associated with this tire system. . .

On the ramp, while cornering even slightly, there was a rubbing sound from the rear wheel area. In a straight line, it sounded okay, but didn't feel right. When we were able to park and get out, the rear wheels were splayed out (extreme negative camber) as if the car was grossly overloaded, even though if was empty. Upon inspection, I found that the two rear mounts for the subframe had completely pulled out of the unibody. The subframe had rusted from the inside, so there was no appearance of structurally significant rust until it failed. When the suspension subframe pulled away, it pulled apart the wiring for the abs, etc. This is a very unsafe condition that appeared with no warning.

1243,Honda,Pilot,2007 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"I bought a 2007 Honda Pilot ex-l 2wd. I am disabled, so I require a hitch, electric chair lift to carry my electric wheelchair. I previously had a 2003 Toyota highlander 2wd, 4 cyl, with the exact same configuration. Since I have adapted my 2007 Honda Pilot with the equipment, I have found this vehicle is not capable of carrying the tongue weight load of about 350 lbs, which Honda published is adequate (I. E. Honda states a 2wd Pilot is capable of towing 3,500 lbs and a 4wd is capable of towing 4,500 lbs, which equates to an allowable tongue weight of 10% of towing weight which is 350 lbs for the 2wd and 450 lbs for the 4wd). I have spoken with the chief mechanic at hollywood Honda; the hitch experts; professionals at my wheelchair/lift facility and everyone agreew the 2007 Honda Pilot can not carry the tongue weight of 350 lbs in a safe and effective manner. The vehicle starts to lower the back end and the front end starts to lift upwards as the weight of the wheelchair on the lift starts to ascend. When the back end of the Honda Pilot has ""bottomed out"", then the wheelchair and lift start to ascend. When the wheelchair and lift ascend to its proper height as designed by the lift manufacturer, the lift and wheelchair are in a very vulnerable position which is not high enough to keep the lift from bottoming out and the entire wheelchair and lift from ""bouncing"" in manner which is uncontrollable, whcih gives the sensation of being out of control. Meanwhile, the front end of the Honda Pilot has escalated about 6 - 8 inches above its normal level plain. If Honda has conducted its evaluations in a satisfactory and safe manner as they publish a 2wd Honda Pilot can tow 3,500 lbs and a 4wd Honda Pilot can tow 4,500 lbs, then why can't the Honda Pilot effectively maintain the normal tongue weight of 10% of the towing weight which they stipulate? if you can assist me in making some determination pertaining to this issue, I will be gratefully appreciative.",  01/11/2007

I was told by Honda that someone would get back to me within two weeks regarding the loaner, and that it would not be possible to order the replacement part for the recall until fall 2016.

I had spoken with one individual who works on Honda's at a Honda garage and isn't it interesting he suggest it may be a sensor or electrical issue with the acceleration system. . . . . . But oddly enough, he hasn't heard of this either, but upon research, I've found it all over the internet. I told my insurance company, ""shouldn't we start somewhere. "".",  06/16/2017

She also said the transmission switch I had replaced was in need of an update which would further cure my problems. Finally they were to check the bushings due to recall. She assured me the recalls would cure all but the radio issue I had but they would check that out while they had my vehicle. They found nothing but the bushings. I filed complaint with Honda corp that dealer wont uphold recalls as they dont get error codes. They told corp rep they had my car several days which is a lie. They had it about 4 hours from when they opened until I picked up. Corp rep said nothing else we can do.

The sensor wire goes from the middle of the undercarriage to each rear wheel and is totally unprotected. Also, the sensor and wire are one piece and should have a connector rather than one piece so it could be repaired. Additionally, the wire should be encased in a wire conduit (the flexible wire conduit that could be purchased from a parts store. ) this would add some level of protection. And a mere tree branch in the road can sever the cables. The manual suggests that the illuminated warning lights, if ignored, can cause injury or death. I was in a long tunnel and could not even pull over. After researching on line, this is a common problem with this flaw.

We found out that we had lost 4 out of 6 cylinders due to the spark plugs being fouled. This could have been a serious safety issue and could have caused a major accident on a interstate highway had all the cylinders been lost at one time. Was traveling with wife and 2 kids at time of incident. To me there should be a recall for 2010 Honda Pilots as this is a known problem through Honda.

We were rather fortunate in that our reliable auto repair service man told us that a car with this low mileage should not have rotors issues- that this is definitely a manufacturers defect and to check with a Honda dealer. So we called the dealer we purchased the car from and he said they called Honda and there are no problems. So I found this web site- I copied and pasted over 7 full pages of complaints regarding this issue. So Honda is blind siding us and I will shout rather loudly because this is ridiculous. Do they need to have hundreds of reported fatalities like the airbags before they fix it. I will not drive this car on the highway until they fix it.,  02/03/2016

The vehicle mileage was 33194 miles and current mileage is 92000. We live in madison, WI. During 2013-14 winter sessions there were many days the weather was very cold here. One day when the weather was very cold (probably -10 f), I took the car from my office parking lot. The car was parked for little over 8hours. As soon as, I came out of the parking lot, I need to take left. When I tried to apply brake to stop, the brake was not engaging. I was not able to press the brake. After couple of blocks, I will come to a t junction and I need to take left on that. The cross traffic does not stop at the junction. The car wasn't stopping and I took a hard right turn. Again I took a hard right turn in 100-200 feet. The brakes were not engaging at all. After so many times of pressing hard, finally I was able to apply brake and stop the car. It was a scary moment thinking that the car is going to crash somewhere. I called my Honda technician and he mentioned that it could be because of cold weather and I should call him again if the problem returns. There were a few times, I faced the same problem. I was able to engage the brakes after a few minutes each time. I took to the Honda service center in Feb 2014 (or around that time). The technician checked and told me that they will call Honda to find out about this since another Honda vehicle (not Pilot) reported similar issue. When I went to take back the car, I was told that there is no fix to this issue. The workaround is to run the car for a while before I drive. Sometimes we forget and the problem is coming repeatedly even when the temperature is in single digit. I faced the problem just a few days back too.

For the last six months the cars steering wheel and seat shake violently when you apply the brakes going over 50 mph. When the weather is warmer and the car has been driven for over 1/2 hour, the shaking gets even worse. You have to reapply the brakes and hope that the car slows down. We had the roters turned and it got better for a week and then right back to before (out $100) Honda dealership is saying it isa ""normal"" wear and tear issue and there is no reason to be concerned and no safety issue. Sounds like they just don't want to address this dangerous problem. I, also, have never experienced this problem in a car before. I am afraid to drive it, but don't know how to fix it.

When applying the brakes at any speed over 50 mpg, the steering wheel shakes like an earthquake. Dealer said brakes were fine and that there was no issue. Next trip the dealer said the brakes might need to be redone . And that the rotors were warped. Repairs would not be covered under warranty or extended warranty.

I put my blinkers on informing other vehicle I was going to pull into my driveway. I waited for the other vehicle passed then proceeded to gently pressed on the gas, that'¿¿s when the vehicle accelerated violently speeding onto my driveway. I immediately slammed down on the brakes but it instead of stopping the car accelerated even faster. The vehicle crashed into my house damaging the pillar wall structure next to my garage door. I tried putting the vehicle in park but it was jammed. When it finally allowed me to put it in park I put it in reverse and again it accelerated uncontrollably. I slammed down on the brakes but it wouldn'¿¿t stop. The only way it stopped is when it crashed into the vehicle parked across the street. I had nightmares ever since. I had sent it to the Honda dealership and expressed my concern with the car and informed them that I no longer feel safe in this Honda Pilot and no longer want to drive my car. Honda had told me they didn'¿¿t find anything wrong with the car. I couldn'¿t believe what I was hearing. In the 20+ years of driving I've never experienced having a car accelerate. I truly believe Honda is covering up and trying to protect themselves from a law suit. They are capable of easily fixing the problem without reporting it. Who'¿¿s to question them or checked if they did their job correctly or if there was a problem with the throttle, brakes or engine? now no one will ever know the truth. I believe that the Honda Pilot 2011 is not a save car to drive and needs to be recalled and have an independent company examine it.",  04/16/2013

This is the second time I have felt the car engine rev on it's own with my foot off the gas and jumping forward. First time was while slowing down to a stop sign and the car jumped forward and accelerated on it's own but with no accident. I dismissed it not sure why it happened. This time of course I felt the same symptom with foot on brake the car jolted forward and engine revved on it's own but hitting the car in front of me. I hope Honda fixes this issue.

1528,Honda,Pilot,2011 Pilot,Service Brakes,Service Brakes problems,"Driver was pulling into a parking space when the 2011 Honda Pilot suddenly accelerated out of control. At the time of the sudden acceleration, the driver did not have a foot on either the gas pedal or brake. Rather, the driver had just taken the foot off the gas pedal in the process of slowing to a stop and turning into the parking space, and was about to place a foot on the brake. After straightening into the parking space, the car accelerated violently on its own volition. At that time, the driver quickly pressed a foot on the brake. The brake did not work. The car continued to accelerate through the brake, and lunged over a concrete barrier at the end of the parking space and began to travel down a hill on the other side. The car only stopped when it hit a tree near the top of the hill. The vehicle was towed to the dealer. The dealer informed the driver that it was unable to recreate the incident or determine the cause. The driver contacted and complained to the manufacturer, Honda of America, which sent a regional representative to the dealer to look at the vehicle in further detail. Currently, Honda of America is in the process of finalizing its review of the incident. The driver's insurance company was notified. The mileage of the vehicle at the time of the incident is unknown (as the car is currently with the dealer), but the driver estimates it to be around 18,000 miles. The speed at the time of the incident is difficult to determine as the car was nearing a stop and then forcefully accelerated through the length of a parking spot with enough force to jump the concrete barrier on the other side and hit a tree causing significant damage. The driver estimates the speed to have reached 15-25 mph +/-. While the driver suffered only minor injuries, the driver is pregnant. The full extent of any potential injuries to the baby are yet to be determined.",  09/05/2012

I research the web and found out, lots of Honda Pilot owner are having the same problems and that the remedy for it was replacing 1. Power steering pump 2. Power steering rack.

Warping problem re-appeared at approximately 30k. Warped rotors caused severe vibrations through steering column at highway speeds making for unsafe driving conditions. Honda tech mentioned that Honda used rotors with a softer material in an effort to reduce squealing problem on previous year models. However, this resulted in warping problems on newer models as car is heavier and these rotors are not sufficient in stopping the vehicles without causing significant wear. At 55k miles, I decided to replace rotors with a third party since Honda refused to stand behind their defective product and replace my rotors even though I had reported the problem well before the standard factory warranty period of 3 years / 36k miles.

Apparently, Honda has or is in the process of redesigning this bushing. If vehicle is out of warranty, one has to pay for the repairs but in a few cases it appears that Honda reduced the cost or may of fixed it for free after the owners pressed their case.

Others per the internet had pulling to one side or the other or juddering when applying the brakes or premature tire wear.

From the first day of driving it, I noticed a vibration coming from the drive train/engine/transmission when the engine was switching into ""eco"" mode. The vibration can be felt through the steering wheel, gas pedal, and floor board. It becomes worse when cruising at a low rpm, or when climbing a hill (no matter how steep the hill is) when the eco mode is engaged. The vibration only stops when the car is required to increase the rpm, either from manually depressing the gas pedal, or the computer deciding it needs more power. The vehicle does not experience this vibration until the engine warms up and the eco mode engages. When the engine is cold, the eco mode does not kick in, and there is no vibration. The problem seems to be getting worse. Vehicle constantly vibrates/shudders as engine run in eco mode and as vcm kicks in/out or is in use. I see hundreds of same complaint on Honda message boards and all have gotten the same response from Honda. They indicate it is normal operation and nothing they can do. Anyone that's driven a vehicle for more than a few hours can tell you it's not normal for a vehicle to vibrate like that.

When all of this was happening, my sensors never went off. Although when my truck came to a stop , I put it in park and got out to see if the person in front of me was ok. I noticed that I was within 2 inches of her bumper and when I got back in my truck, the sensor was only beeping. I contacted american Honda who advised me to take it to Honda of bowie, where I purchased the vehicle. I was told that an inspector from american Honda and the service manager from Honda of bowie would inspect the truck thoroughly. After doing so, they informed my husband that there was nothing wrong with the vehicle and there was nothing they could do. I feel there is a safety issue with this truck and I am very nervous and anxious when driving it.

From what I read this has been an issue with the model year I own, however it also states it can cause the car to not accelerate properly which when driving on highways as much as I do, can be a safety concern. I feel this issue should have been resolved with a recall versus an extended warranty, due to this took place right after the 8 year mark of it being purchased. Losing acceleration on a major highway, with cars and semi trucks driving well at 80 mph or more, can be a scary thing if the car will not accelerate properly due to an issue that has been reported, taken to court and in the end should have been corrected versus extending the powertrain warranty. The cost per our local Honda dealership will be $4,000 which is about what I have left to have the vehicle paid off.

I have owned two cherokees but did not buy a new one because of , the reduced windows, poor visibility and horrible forward tilting head restraints, the cherokee is like being in a coffin so I had to look at another manufacturer. Over all the Pilot is a good option with much bigger windows and visibility but the head restraints are also terrible. I can not rest my back on the back of the seat in a fairly upright position without my head pushed forward by the head restraint. I tried but ended up with a head ache every time I drove the car. What is the car industry thinking? do people sit in these cars/SUV's? I know many that say just recline your seat. What the hell help is that? I don't like to be reclined or am I comfortable reclined plus does that not defeat the point of a head restraint? a person should be able to sit in their car and have their seat support their body while also aligning the head restraint to support their head from injury on impact. The car manufacturers need to get their heads in the game and make the cars safe but comfortable without having to recline your seat as if you are in a lazyboy chair.

Honda had told me they didn'¿¿t find anything wrong with the car. I couldn'¿t believe what I was hearing. In the 20+ years of driving I've never experienced having a car accelerate. I truly believe Honda is covering up and trying to protect themselves from a law suit. They are capable of easily fixing the problem without reporting it. Who'¿¿s to question them or checked if they did their job correctly or if there was a problem with the throttle, brakes or engine? now no one will ever know the truth.

Not leather! the hand rest on all doors and center console are all torn and stretched to reveal the trim was thin strips of some sort of rubber. Now all seats are also cracked and torn after the vinyl hardened. I feel as if I was fleeced by Honda. Had I known the interior was rubber and vinyl I would have stuck with the fabric seats. Additionally the vehicle kept shutting down only to find out the throttle body was defective. The vehicle 'eats' brake pads and the emergency does not work properly. I learnt the hard way few months after purchasing my vehicle. I parked it in my driveway which has a very slight incline, placed it in neutral and applied the brakes and stepped out, only to hear horns blowing. On checking, the vehicle had rolled into the street.

I have put approximately 5k miles on the vehicle and immediately noticed an engine vibration similar to being in the wrong gear in a manual transmission. I took the car into the Honda dealership and asked them to check the transmission- as I initially thought that it was a ""hunting"" issue with the transmission- the dealer indicated that it was normal. The more I drive the vehicle, the more it appears to be related to the engine and not the transmission. The vibration is very annoying and not normal. Honda needs to step-up and take care of the problem. Too many issues out there with others with same complaints.

1712,Honda,Pilot,2012 Pilot,Service Brakes,Service Brakes problems,On April 30 2014 my wife lisa kettig entered the children¿s hospital of philadelphia campus in the 2012 Honda Pilot. She approached the guard booth and came to a complete stop. This can be verified as the guard stopped her and they had a brief conversation about where to park. Lisa then accelerated out of the guard booth while making an immediate low speed right turn down a ramp into a parking garage. From this point the Honda Pilot continued to accelerate down the ramp as she applied the brakes. The car accelerated out of control and failed to brake. It jumped a small median and eventually hit a concrete block wall at the bottom of the ramp. Lisa maintains that she was applying the brakes during the descent down the ramp up the moment of impact and the car was still continuing to accelerate and brakes did not respond. I contacted Honda and submitted a written request that the event data recorder (edr) be tested. A representative from Honda called me on September 6 (I was only given a first name of reggie) he explained that on or about August 19 a technician examined the vehicle and determined that no pre accident data could be recovered. He explained that while the 2012 Honda Pilot has an edr only some of these vehicles have the ability to record pre accident data and that mine did not have this ability. He also said that I would not receive a report or any confirmation in writing about the incident or subsequent examination of the vehicle. The owner manual indicates that edrs has the ability to record data up to 30 seconds prior to the accident it will report if the accelerator or brake was being activated at the moment of impact. It will also indicate the vehicle speed. My request is that Honda follow through and test the edr to determine if the brakes and or accelerator malfunctioned as lisa maintains and supply the results to me.,  04/30/2014

The steering would vibrate when applying the brakes. I took it to the dealership on 28th. The dealership told me I was "" hard braking"" and that was causing the rotors to warp. I asked them to clarified "" hard braking. "" it was just a general answer that no abrupt force on the brakes. I have driven Toyota, Buick, oldsmobiles, and chevy. I never had a rotor warped that early in mileage. I believed there is a major defects in the Pilot 2012 braking mechanism. I wish some agency can perform more rigid tests to confirm this.

One of my daughters was traveling in the front passenger seat and the other one was I seated behind me. I had been traveling for about 45 minutes at a maximum speed of approximately 20 mph, as traffic would clear and then become congested again. I was maintaining about 5 car lengths between my car and the car ahead of me. I tapped my accelerator to move up which caused my Pilot to shoot forward. I thought to myself it was lucky I had maintained a good distance with the car in front and applied the brakes to slow down. The car continued to surge, and I could hear the engine revving. I began screaming, and my daughter in the front seat was yelling for me to hit the brakes. I told her I was pressing the brakes, but the car continued to accelerate, despite my applying with great pressure on the brake. My daughter could also hear the engine revving. We slammed into the car in front of us, and continued moving. This car rear ended a pick up truck which finally stopped my Pilot. Both front seat airbags deployed, and my car became attached to the car I rear ended. Luckily, everyone involved in the accident was able to walk away, but if the driver I had struck had passengers, there definitely would have been severe injuries.

I pressed the gas pedal to move behind my husband's truck and it moved up a little before it accelerated to a high speed slamming his truck into the garage and crushing it. I hit the brakes, but it didn't help. The engine was revving and tires were spinning as fast as they could. The airbag hit me in the face causing me to jerk the steering wheel to the right, which then caused the Pilot to drive across my front yard at a high speed crashing into my neighbor's tree with my foot still on the brake! the engine only stopped when my husband ran out of my house and turned off the Pilot. At that point, I didn't know what was happening because I had been hit so hard in the face by the airbag. The Pilot was inspected today by Honda corporate at a Honda dealership against my better judgment. Of course after a thorough inspection, ""no cause was found for unintentional acceleration.

I brought the vehicle to a Honda dealer and was told the front rotors should be refaced when the car needs new brake pads. I have had a 2006,2009, and 2012 Pilot. My driving habits have not changed, the mileage per year is consistent, and there has been no hard or excessive braking. I have not had this problem with the other model years. So, what's the problem? are the current rotors thinner or inferior?.",  11/20/2013

In early June we took it down to baltimore when I noticed that there is something wrong with the brakes or steering problems when I applied some braking over 65mph and going down hill was extremely apparent. The steering would vibrate when applying the brakes. I took it to the dealership on 28th. The dealership told me I was "" hard braking"" and that was causing the rotors to warp. I asked them to clarified "" hard braking. "" it was just a general answer that no abrupt force on the brakes. I have driven Toyota, Buick, oldsmobiles, and chevy. I never had a rotor warped that early in mileage. I believed there is a major defects in the Pilot 2012 braking mechanism. I wish some agency can perform more rigid tests to confirm this. I am no expert mechanic, but I have driven many miles due to my sales position both in highway and mostly city driving. And I know that a rotor should not warped that much due to "" hard braking. "" I am a parent of two children, age 2 and 1. And I fear this is going to be an ongoing problem with the Pilot brakes/ rotors problems and it is not cover under warranty cause the company/ dealership thinks it normal wear and tear. So if anyone that has Pilot 2009 or newer, please pay attention and file a complaint to dealership and the company before a tragic might occur. Being proactive is much better than the latter. In the end, after I got my car back from the dealership. I drove and I realized when I apply the brakes under 20mph less than 20 yards to ease the braking, I feel the Pilot ""jerk"" back and forth. This is not normal after a re-surfaced of the rotors. I guess back to the dealership again.",  06/14/2013

I have to be very cautious when entering an intersection or pulling onto a freeway as my vehicle declines to accelerate as it needs to causing people to run into me almost. It is a pretty significant delay for the vehicle to catch up on its own and could be very dangerous for anyone.

In addition to vibration, engine makes a chirping noise when accelerating through vibration. I believe they are related although neither have been able to be fixed. No warning lights illuminate. I purchased this car for the 4wd as I live in snow/ice climate. However, excessive vibration/shudder makes driving in these conditions (any conditions) unsafe due to constant need to fluctuate acceleration/ deceleration to help minimize vibration/shudder to regain sense of control. If you maintain speed while vibrating on snow/ice you feel like you are losing control. This vibration has to have a long-term effect on engine/car integrity. It's strong enough that some day I imagine I'll come to a stop and at that very moment, every screw will have come loose/undone from years of vibrating and I'll be left sitting in the seat holding just the steering wheel with the car in parts all around me.",  11/07/2021

My sister and some friends have Honda cars with eco mode also. How come that they don't experience the same thing with their vehicles. I agree with some complainants that this is a safety issue. It bothers the driver when you experience that vibration from the engine. Is Honda just waiting for someone to die from a car crash with the Pilot before they make a move to correct the issue.

1826,Honda,Pilot,2013 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"Since purchasing new in 2013, experienced ongoing issues with vcm. Noticable vibration/shudder at all speeds except during heavy acceleration. Taken to dealer mant times. They are able to reproduce but state no fix available. It's how the car was made. In addition to vibration, engine makes a chirping noise when accelerating through vibration. I believe they are related although neither have been able to be fixed. No warning lights illuminate. I purchased this car for the 4wd as I live in snow/ice climate. However, excessive vibration/shudder makes driving in these conditions (any conditions) unsafe due to constant need to fluctuate acceleration/ deceleration to help minimize vibration/shudder to regain sense of control. If you maintain speed while vibrating on snow/ice you feel like you are losing control. This vibration has to have a long-term effect on engine/car integrity. It's strong enough that some day I imagine I'll come to a stop and at that very moment, every screw will have come loose/undone from years of vibrating and I'll be left sitting in the seat holding just the steering wheel with the car in parts all around me.",  11/07/2021

Felt the shudder on a highway drive the next day. Now I question if the salesperson knew this would be noticed and deliberately made the test ride short to avoid this being noticed. I even asked her about the vibration issue from reports I had read about before the purchase. I was told this was not an valid issue and that she had owned a Pilot and never felt anything. The car was brought back and a software update was done as well as fluid change in trans within the first month. It still had the shudder. After driving for a few weeks to give it a chance to prove itself and it not me ""looking"" for a problem I called and spoke with the service manager to report this and inform him I would coming back when my schedule allowed. It is getting more frequent and it does not seem to matter whether in eco mode or not. The shudder usually happens around 38-42 mph. But will begin anytime the vehicle cruises in any speed range continually. At higher speeds I can feel my skin shake like one of those fat burning shaking belts from years past. (just so you know I am of average build without excessive body skin. ) brought the car back a second time. That was today Feb. 3, 2016. Went for ride with the service manager. Told him it seems to be getting worse. His conclusion was that this ""shudder"" was a ""characteristic"" of my $28,000 purchase. My 1999 suburban that I traded in had a better ride.

I took my Pilot to the dealer I purchased it from to give them the opportunity to trouble shoot the issue. Initially I thought it was the transmission but they said it was the engine going into eco mode and that it was normal. I have never had a vehicles engine produce the amount of vibration that this one does and to be told its normal to me is unacceptable. I have since read many threads and complaints about this same issue on the internet. This needs to be addressed with Honda and they need to provide a solution.

From the first day of driving it, I noticed a vibration coming from the drive train/engine/transmission when the engine was switching into ""eco"" mode. The vibration can be felt through the steering wheel, gas pedal, and floor board. It becomes worse when cruising at a low rpm, or when climbing a hill (no matter how steep the hill is) when the eco mode is engaged. The vibration only stops when the car is required to increase the rpm, either from manually depressing the gas pedal, or the computer deciding it needs more power.

In 2019, I received a recall notice from american Honda stating that we could have the cost of repainting our recalled vehicles covered if we had damage. At that time, I did not have any issues with the paint on my Pilot. Well, a couple weeks ago, a huge amount of paint on my roof was missing all of a sudden. I contacted american Honda as it stated on the recall notice and was told the recall period and my warranty had expired. Nevertheless, I was told a claim was opened on my behalf and that I needed to take the car to my local Honda dealership for a diagnosis. I was then sent to an authorized body shop for an estimate. After having to contact american Honda and the local dealership multiple times, I was told by the body shop that Honda would only cover 60% of the $1700 cost (which was only for the roof to be repainted) and that eventually the rest of the vehicle will also start to peel.

The dealer said there was nothing wrong with them and that's why they weren't replacing them. I later found out that they also replaced scored bearings. Upon picking up my vehicle, I took it to my mechanic to fix a bushing that the dealer recommended be replaced. My vehicle was also making a tinging noise I want looked at. It was not making this noise prior to being repaired at dealer. My mechanic fixed the bushing and suggested I take it back to the dealer as the issue was a direct result of the burning oil which was a result of the bad pistons. It was then that the dealer told me about the scored bearings. They said they went to their rep because there was damage. I needed a new engine. (apparently this was known when I picked up my car the first time). The rep for the dealership informed them that because my oil changes were done at a private mechanic and not at the dealership, no good will would be given and I would be responsible for replacing the engine at my own cost, as well as the wrecked catalytic converter, also a result of the burned oil from the bad pistons. The dealer suggested I contact american Honda. I did so and after several phone calls the dealer was informed by american Honda that the decision was up to the rep. The dealer reached out to the rep again and again rep refused to fix the problem.

1916,Honda,Pilot,2013 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"Ongoing disturbing shudder or vibration apparently related to the vcm/eco feature. The relationship seems to correlate with the visual eco display on the dashboard. The issue can be categorized by progressing through three stages or modes as speed and driving conditions vary. The first mode can be characterized as a howling (significant audible tone change) from the engine right before the vibration begins, which is the second mode. The second mode is the vibration/shudder most predominately around 44 mph, but can occur at other speeds - depending on the ""load"" on the engine. The shudder/vibration can vary from a high frequency vibration (like going over small narrow rumble strips) to a more pronounced shudder, both of which is can be felt by passengers and/or driver. In general, the Pilot will vibrate/shudder consistently, apparently when the vcm feature is in transition. However, on two occasions, a third mode occurred: very suddenly while driving about 45 mph or so, by surprise, the Pilot shook (front end area) to such a intense degree that it impulsively caused the driver of the Pilot to pull-over and stop. Not knowing what really is going on is causing some trepidation about whether to even drive the car. Took Pilot into the dealer and explained these modes. Dealer was aware of the vcm related vibrations and says that is the way it works and nothing they can do. But, to me this is a real safety issue. A brand new (rather costly) car should not behave this way. Moreover, it seems such regular ongoing vibration/shuddering can quickly negatively impact the integrity or longevity of the engine/drive train, etc. , as most mechanical things generally do not like vibrations which quite often is a significant source of wear and tear. As the owner one must ask things like: will the engine even ""survive"" this in the long run? will this cause more frequent repairs?.",  10/01/2013

There were no objects around the car (I checked for objects that could have flew over and could have hit rear window – there were none). Window shattered completely into tiny pieces - doesnt look like it has been hit by an object. I suspect this is a defective window by the manufacturer. Honda Pilot was less than 2 weeks old and ran 1100 miles. Dealer refused to accept this could be a malfunction. I did a complete visual inspection around car and there were no objects.

1919,Honda,Pilot,2013 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"The problem is a noticble rumble appearing to come from the rearend but affecting every part of the vehicle. It can be felt on the steering wheel, seats, dash, etc. At first we thought it occured at only 62 and 40 mph but the more we drive the vehicle it can be felt at any speed. We had leased a touring Pilot but brought it back after 1400 miles and traded it for a ex-l Pilot hoping the rumble would be less. At first it didn't occur as much, but the more miles it has the worse it gets. The dealership was not very forthcoming with any information on this problem and has no solution or any hope for a solution. The comment was that someone had complained about a vibration but on their test drive they didn't notice it. Any passengers we have immediately notice the rumble and ask what the problem is. On a new car this is embarassing to say the least. If there were any way possible to get out of this lease without getting upsidedown on leasing another vehicle I would do it in a minute. This our fourth Pilot and we have had few problems with them. They are very stable on ice and get through the snow very well. Up until 2013 the Pilot seemed to have a very good ride on the highway and we have taken many long trips with our Pilots. Now any trip we take we our preoccupied with this rumble and are constantly asking each other ""can you feel that"". I am very disappointed with this vehicle and if a fix can't be found for this it will be the last Pilot we lease. I don't know of any safety related incidents to this problem but I can't believe that throughout the life of a vehicle there can be a rumble like this and not cause a problem in the rearend, possibly even locking up.",  04/01/2013

In 2019, I received a recall notice from american Honda stating that we could have the cost of repainting our recalled vehicles covered if we had damage. At that time, I did not have any issues with the paint on my Pilot. Well, a couple weeks ago, a huge amount of paint on my roof was missing all of a sudden. I contacted american Honda as it stated on the recall notice and was told the recall period and my warranty had expired. Nevertheless, I was told a claim was opened on my behalf and that I needed to take the car to my local Honda dealership for a diagnosis. I was then sent to an authorized body shop for an estimate. After having to contact american Honda and the local dealership multiple times, I was told by the body shop that Honda would only cover 60% of the $1700 cost (which was only for the roof to be repainted) and that eventually the rest of the vehicle will also start to peel. I feel cheated and this is truly a lack of customer service on the part of american Honda and proctor Honda.

I told them I was unhappy with this but they said the decision was final. Apparently there is some sort of regional manager that makes these decisions, called the ""dpms"". The body shop manager agreed that it was a defect and told me that they had had problems like this in the past. A few weeks after we got the hood repaired we noticed the same problem happening on the roof of the car. We contacted rusty wallis again and they stated that they would only cover this repair at 50% which leaves me paying about $650. I again told them I was unhappy with this. I called american Honda customer service and they told me that I could schedule a meeting with the dpms. So I called managers and supervisors at rusty wallis. I have even sent rusty wallis a personal email, only to get no calls or emails returned at all from anyone. Someone from american Honda customer service finally called me and said that the dpms would not meet with me and that the decision was final. I can't help but feel completely helpless in all this. It is ridiculous that a 5 year old car's paint would be uncontrollably peeling off. This could just keep happening over and over again until the entire car gets repainted.

Noticable vibration/shudder at all speeds except during heavy acceleration. Taken to dealer mant times. They are able to reproduce but state no fix available. It's how the car was made. In addition to vibration, engine makes a chirping noise when accelerating through vibration. I believe they are related although neither have been able to be fixed. No warning lights illuminate. I purchased this car for the 4wd as I live in snow/ice climate. However, excessive vibration/shudder makes driving in these conditions (any conditions) unsafe due to constant need to fluctuate acceleration/ deceleration to help minimize vibration/shudder to regain sense of control. If you maintain speed while vibrating on snow/ice you feel like you are losing control. This vibration has to have a long-term effect on engine/car integrity. It's strong enough that some day I imagine I'll come to a stop and at that very moment, every screw will have come loose/undone from years of vibrating and I'll be left sitting in the seat holding just the steering wheel with the car in parts all around me.",  11/07/2021

My father has dementia & rheumatoid arthritis and my mother has alzheimer's. My 9 yr old golden retriever was also in the car. When I tried starting the car, it didn't want to turn over. But after a few tries, it started. No indicator lights came on, so I figured it was a fluke. I pulled out of the driveway, began driving (neighborhood - 25mph speed lim) and shortly began hearing knocking noises. After less than a quarter of a mile (crossing suburban main road 35mph speed lim), the car would not respond to the gas pedal. I turned off the air conditioner and rolled down the windows, and I promptly turned around and headed back home. It continued to knock and failed to accelerate above 20 mph. Still, no indicator lights came on. I also checked the temperature gauge and oil gauges and they were also giving normal readings. We failed to make it the quarter-mile back home. Shortly after I turned the corner one street away from our house, there was a sudden explosion in the engine right in front of me in the driver's seat and the front of the car was engulfed in flames. Less than a split second before the explosion, the check oil and check engine lights came on. It didn't even give me enough time to get my finger on the key before it set ablaze. My father can't walk well and uses a scooter. Both my parents are diminished mentally and could not unlock their doors which did not unlock automatically. If I hadn't rolled down the windows, & if this had happened on the main road instead of our neighborhood where people came to help, I could not have gotten everyone out in time.

1999,Honda,Pilot,2014 Pilot,Engine And Engine Cooling,Engine And Engine Cooling problems,"1. Our 2014 Honda Pilot exl with only 70,000 miles on it needs a complete engine replacement. The cause was determined to be driving with low oil. The oil life gauge read 50% and we had an oil change only 3 months earlier. No check engine light or low oil light came on, so we had no way of knowing the oil was low unless someone qualified had done a manual inspection which ordinary drivers don't/can't do. In our view the warning lights and/or oil life gauge all failed to warn us of any issue of this nature, therefore letting it get to the point whereby the car needs a complete engine replacement. 2. Unknown. We were lucky that we noticed the smell of fuel/burning close to home so we were thankfully not left stranded on the side of the road. But we were left stranded 500 miles from home while on vacation with no car. It was an absolute nightmare. 3. Yes, we had to tow the vehicle 40 miles to the nearest Honda dealership who confirmed that the engine needs replacing. 4. Yes, the nearest Honda dealership inspected the vehicle. 5. No, and that is the issue. No warnings lamps appeared. The smell of fuel/burning coming from the engine alerted us to the fact that there was an issue and the engine fan carried on running even after the ignition was turned off. Prior to this we had no idea there was an issue with the vehicle. We took care of the vehicle, doing regular oil changes and fluid replacement, etc. Fyi - telling someone that they need to manually check the oil level as you should not rely on the oil life gauge and/or the various warning lights that are designed to detect this problem is both devoid from reality and is akin to telling people that they should manually dip the gas tank to check the gas level as you should not rely on the gas gauge etc. That makes no practical sense and the vast majority of car owners don't do it.",  07/07/2022

I looked down at my dashboard and the over heating warning light was bright yellow-- I immediately pulled over into a parking lot with my 2 young kids, got them out of the car, and began to try and figure out what was going on. Thank goodness I didn't ignore this issue and that I was able to pull off of the road when I did. This could have been a very unsafe situation for myself, my kids, and other motorists. Prior to this moment there were no indicators of anything being wrong with the vehicle, there was absolutely no warning of what I am about to describe either. Luckily, my husband was nearby and able to pick us up. There was a milky fluid leaking from underneath the car and when my husband opened the hood he said that oil and water had mixed--it looked like something had just exploded. Needless to say I had to have the vehicle towed to a shop. After taking the engine out and sending parts off to a machinist it was determined that the front cylinder head had cracked and the rear cylinder head had to be resurfaced due to the damage. Several mechanics have noted that there is no reasonable explination for the cylinder head to crack before 200,000 miles. I had just purchased this vehicle in September 2020, it had 72,000 miles on it then. It currently has around 80,000 miles on it.

2055,Honda,Pilot,2015 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"Complaint - Honda no longer provides a maintenance schedule for the vehicles. It instead relies on a maintenance minder system. I change my oil more frequently than the recommended 7500 miles, which means that the maintenance minder no longer works, as it is thrown off by the more frequent oil changes, as well as by my low mileage. I have had my vehicle 5. 5 years, and received only one maintenance code during that time period - while I have had to change various fluids during that same time period to be on the safe side and in an effort to ensure proper maintenance of the vehicle. I believe manufacturers should be required to continue to provide a maintenance schedule for their vehicles. If I were to rely solely on the maintenance minder, I fear that necessary maintenance would not be performed. And no, I do not use a dealership to perform my maintenance - I use an independent shop.

(for some reason I could not populate the date field on the form. ) as I was driving, the car lost all power. Even the steering would not respond, although I was able to pull over with great difficulty before it completely stopped. I restarted the car and was able to drive the block to home. I contacted the dealer and was told there were no appointments until Friday but to take it in under the express service, which I plan to do this afternoon. I did search the internet to see if other Honda Pilot owners have had a similar problem and found that indeed it has been a problem for other Honda Pilot owners. Additionally, on two different tires, I had to have repairs due to nails in the tire causing slow leaks. I previously owned a 2013 Honda Pilot, same model (touring) and had the same tire problems.

Visibility was completely lost while traveling in a very light rain in non flood conditions at entry ramp speeds and then again when we were cruising at about 65 mph, down the toll road. The rain was so light that the wipers were on delay and did not activate during the incident. This is obviously a very serious design flaw for this vehicle.

The exact same issue has happened again repeatedly. It happened again 6 months later after I left san antonio, I now live in houston. I have met with many mechanics, one master mechanic told me he was sure it a was a defective piston ring . Most mechanics have just been changing the coil and spark plugs. He told me this was waste of my money since it is not the real issue. Up on his recommendation, I sought a second opinion at at Honda dealership since I felt it was strange for a piston ring needing to be changed. Without me saying anything descriptive about vehicle, they immediately told me, its the pistons, we can change them (6) for 4000. Did not tell me why or what caused this unusual defect. Upon researching I found Honda Pilots 2008-2013 models have same exact issue and were part of a recall to have them replaced. The same issue is happening to me.

I have to turn on hazard light, and it is getting worse every occurrence. This has happened since I bought new, and when it happens, all of the lights come up on the dash. There is a investigation in the state of California, but nothing in ohio yet. 2) I just had to replace my drive shaft that goes from from to back on center bottom of the car. They said the rear is failing, and that may be part of the problem with sluggish acceleration. 3) transmission: sluggish acceleration is this zf 9 speed (outsourced) by Honda issue. I will be accelerating on the freeway, and all of the sudden, it would down shift to like second gear, causing me to slow down suddenly. Dangerous if cars are behind in rush hour. I also had 4 incidents where I could have lost my life because I could not accelerate (the gear would not engage). Dealer informed me that all of the updates are uploaded, and it should be okay. But it's not okay when you are carrying your children, spouse, or CO-workers. I have informed the dealer many times that this car is not safe. I personally ran a business as tier 1 supplier to Honda and visited many Honda factories. Nothing ever got done. It will be too late before they can help us.

Instead the gear was stuck and I had to remove my foot from the gas pedal and try again. I have taken the vehicle too two different dealerships and they could not replicate the problem. One dealership checked the transmission cooler and stated it was in good condition.

2227,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"There is no way for the driver of the car to put the transmission into neutral if needed with an electrical/battery failure. According to Honda, there is a special mechanical device that tow truck drivers would have that physically attaches to the engine to shift the car into neutral. In addition, the Honda mechanic that I talked to today said even if the average driver had one of these devices, they would not recommend they use it due to likelihood of causing damage to the engine or transmission. This is fine if the car is already in park, since it would most likely be located in a parking lot, residence, etc. The two times that would be a safety issue and could very easily cause an accident would be if the car was in drive, stopped at a traffic light with the engine off due to the auto start/stop feature, and suffered a battery failure, preventing the engine from starting. Now the car would not be able to start, but more importantly couldn't even be pushed off to the side of the road and clear the intersection, since there is no way to move it into neutral. Another example could be with an alternator failure while driving, where the battery then surges and drains itself, with the engine and car now shut down. If you are unable to move the car to the side of the road as this is happening, maybe stuck in traffic or stopped at a traffic light, the car is now unmovable until a tow truck driver arrives and installs this mechanical neutral unlock device. There should be a way with an electrical problem to be able to place the car into neutral and move it. Otherwise, this turns a routine auto problem (that has had an acceptable solution) into a true safety issue, both for occupants and other vehicles and their operators.",  12/29/2021

Luckily we were close to a fire station house and stopped there, where the car was not going into park, was not changing any gears to reverse or neutral and when turned on, all emergency lights were flashing and could not even get it into neutral to push it away as it seemed to be transmission wheel jammed.

2239,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"We have a 2016 Honda Pilot touring. Since early 2018 we have been having issues with the idle stop system. The problem is when we are driving and we come to stop in traffic at a light, the idle stop system engages and shuts the engine down, like it is suppose to do. Once the light turns green for traffic to move, I release the brake and the idle stop system tries to engage and turn the engine on again, but fails and shuts the whole vehicle down, inoperable. The lights flash and I cannot turn the car on again for at least 1 to 2 minutes. Vehicles are honking and traffic is blaring across us, but I cannot turn the vehicle back on. After 2 minutes, I can restart the vehicle by pushing the button and brake and then the vehicle moves. This is a safety issue, since you never know when it wil lol happen, but it has always happened while in heavy trafffic or a busy intersection.

The dealer of course said they could not recreate the issue and did not see anything when they tested the system. They just pawned it off on the battery, even though the battery is less than 2 years old and testing just fine. There is no way to permanently disable the system and if I forget to push the idle stop disengage button every time I start the vehicle, I could end up on the road in the middle of traffic and some driver decides not to pay attention and run into me and my disabled vehicle.

2249,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"I was driving on a dual two lane highway at 55 mph. At a cross road a traffic light was red, and I stopped the vehicle. The automatic idle stop shut off the engine for 1/2 to 1 minute, before the traffic light turned green. When I took my foot off the break, the car should have started, but it didn't. . Many of the dashboard lights came on, the car shifted into neutral. The cars around me moved forward and several honked, because I wasn't moving. Other cars were approach me from behind at speed. I tried to turn the ignition off and restart it. Nothing happened because the shift was in neutral. I exited the car and pushed it to the right turn lane just ahead and pushed the brake to stop once I was out of the driving lane. I put the car in park with my foot on the brake and tried to start the engine 2 or 3 times before the starter turned the engine over. Several cars went by at speed, and luckily no one wanted to turn right. The car is just over 5 years old and I am very familiar with its operation with the automatic idle stop feature, but this time it surprised me. I had replaced the battery after 2. 5 years of driving, and it is only 1 year and 10 months since it was replaced. I have read anecdotal accounts of similar incidences by other 2016 Pilot owners who had no reason for the incident. The car did not have any further problems that day, because I cancelled the idle stop feature for the trip home. I feel I could easily have become a statistic along with my wife had the traffic been moderately greater that evening. Other have registered complaints about this problem on this website. I am having the battery replace tomorrow, even though the dealer hasn't yet evaluated its condition.",  06/27/2020

2251,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"Issue: car is unable to start when on a city street and auto-start is enabled (stalling). This has happened on several occasions over the last couple years. My wife is the primary driver she often has the kids in the car which creates a large safety issue for my family. When the problem first presented itself, there was one time where the car unintentionally accelerated on it's own with my family in the car. Unfortunately that was not able to be replicated as well nor have we experienced it again. Potential solution 1: battery has been replaced which temporarily stopped the issue, however within months the issue is back. Potential solution 2: it's worth noting that the transmission was replaced recently, however it was not due to this the stalling issue, there was an actual issue with the transmission. The stalling stopped for a while as well, then came back again. Concerns: we are concerned with our safety in this vehicle which doesn't give ownership of this car a good feeling. While we can chose to sell this car and pass this issue to someone else who in turn could get hurt or killed if they are in the wrong place at the wrong time and that should not be the case. We shouldn't wait for people to get hurt/killed by this to do something about it. We're hoping with the continued reports of this issue there will be something done by Honda to resolve this.

Something is majorly wrong with the electrical parts when this happens. Lights flash, my hazards didn’t even work today, which was very scary and not safe. The only door that would open was my driver side door. This is a huge safety concern and I am now looking for a new car. This has happened at least 20-30 times, but today was the worst.

There was no recall and due to the nature of the incident, it is not covered by an warranties once you pass a certain mileage (80,000, I believe). Unfortunately, this issue/alarm did not pop until after I had passed that mileage point and because it falls under an emissions system problem, not a drivetrain, I have to pay out of pocket.

2268,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Other Fuel System,Other Fuel System problems,"Since buying my 2016 Honda Pilot elite in June of 2021 I have had innumerable instances of my vehicle's auto stop start feature failing to start after being engaged. I believe the first instance was in sept 2021 (after the lemon law time frame passed for my state). When my vehicle is stopped, I try to hit the gas and the vehicle does not go. At this same time an error happens on the screen that says ""shift car to p"". The first few times this has happened I tried to shift to p and that did not help. I figured out that it is best (I. E. Quickest, I am not sure it is the best for the vehicle) to just turn the car off. Wait a few seconds, and then turn the car back on and put it back into drive and go. Keep in mind that I have cars peeling by me, screaming at me, honking, yelling, etc. All with my 6/7yo daughter in the vehicle. I am often stuck in an intersection going left. Additionally, sometimes but not always, the radio and heat/ac turn off when this happens. This has occurred far more times than I can count but a few examples in bumper to bumper city traffic, when waiting to make a left hand turn in intersections, while taking turns at a stop sign both flat and uphill (which is terrifying), just while being stopped at red lights and having the light turn green, when taking turns to enter a rotary, when trying to go at a yield sign, etc. There is no warning light or lamp. The warning lights/sounds occur while/after its already happened. Sometimes the radio turns off and the heat/ac. I have had the vehicle repeatedly serviced by the dealer I purchased it from. They said they cannot replicate the issue. They have asked me to take video of it which is infuriating and unsafe as I am in the vehicle with a child in traffic, sometimes in the middle of an intersection, trying not to get t-boned.

While we have not had an accident yet, we have come close due to cars behind us not knowing our vehicle is having an issue.

2287,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Electronic Stability Control,Electronic Stability Control problems,I've had several issues with my 2016 Honda Pilot in the past few months. I currently have 110k miles on my vehicle but my problems began at around 80k. My check engine light and several other lights illuminate constantly. At first they would light up and go away. Brought it to service. They said there were no recalls and they change my spark plugs and told me to drive my car on at least a half tank of gas. Problem continued and then my car started running rough and idling rougher. I brought it in again and was told I needed to replace my fuel injectors. That was taken care and I still have a check engine light illuminates along with emissions system problem warming and my car still runs rough and has trouble accelerating. Song with all of these issues I've also had to replace my ignition and key fob and my auto start is not working. I have over a100k on the car which I understand can cause wear and tear but all of these problems far exceed the definition of normal wear and tear. I'd like to know if there is a recall on anything and what can be done to remedy these situations. My car is at service yet again trying to find out what is causing it to run so rough.

The issue is that the lift gate starts to open, but then closes itself for no reason and does not stop closing even if a person or obstacle is underneath. Sometimes the lift gate also will not reopen. Our ongoing concern is that a child or other person will be crushed beneath the malfunctioning lift gate. This has happened in all types of scenarios - when the car is parked flat, on an incline, inside, outside, etc. And there does not seem to be a consistent cause. Also, our Honda dealer is often unable to identify the problem using their computer system - they have told us nothing is wrong with the lift gate until they have watched this happen.",  12/09/2019

Under certain conditions when driving down a two lane highway and a semi goes by in the other direction or when passing a semi on the interstate you can see the movement of the hood from the front to the back as the air flows underneath. It looks like the hood lifts from latch and then flexes, moves or shakes as air flows guess that's best way to describe it. On the interstate I have even noticed shaking/movement when driving if it's windy without passing a semi. Car wash dryer also causes the hood to shake. I have taken to dealer and they tried adjusting the latch - that didn't help. Stopped by another dealer and they said to adjust the rubber bumpers on each side under hood but that didn't help either. It's pretty scary to see this happening. What if the latch doesn't hold one of these times? the hood flying off going 65-75mph is not a pleasant thought.

A serious accident could have occurred if both my slider wasn't closed and/or the car behind me was close to me. I've had the car for less than 3 months, I contacted Honda and advised them of the incident and brought it in to their service department. They claimed to have never heard of anything like this happening before. They have ordered a replacement glass for my sunroof. I'm still waiting for it come in. I also went online and researched sunroofs breaking out of nowhere and did come across many other similar complaints. It seems that it may be happening more frequently with newer vehicles because they are built lighter with thinner metals and thinner glass. The glass used on sunroofs more commonly is tempered glass, not laminated glass. Tempered glass is more prone to shattering when pressure builds up inside the car. When I spoke to Honda corporate and the dealer, neither one could tell me what kind of glass was on the sunroof because they didn't know. I hope this matter can be further looked into.

As I approached the yukon I reapplied the brake. The car accelerated to what sounded like full rpm's and I applied the brakes as hard as I could and nothing happened. The car slammed into the yukon with such an impact that both front airbags deployed. The driver side airbag hit me in the face. The passenger airbag did not reach my wife in the passenger seat. She immediately experienced severe chest pain and rapid heart beat. Bystanders called 911 and two park rangers arrived in approx. 15-20 minutes.

The vehicle worked perfectly until we were on our way home Saturday, July 22, 2017. We were on I-10 approximately 1 hour east of phoenix in the right lane with the cruse set at the 75mph speed limit. There were no cars in front of us for at least a mile. All the sudden, without any warning whatsoever, nearly all the vehicle system lights came on and the vehicle slowed at an emergency rate down to approximately 40mph in about 2 seconds. I immediately hit �cancel� on the cruise and stepped on the gas, but the vehicle continued to slow quickly. I immediately started to move to the shoulder of the road and noticed the 18 wheel tractor trailer behind us make an emergency swerve to the left and missed hitting us by inches. We were nearly involved in an accident that could have easily been fatal. All this took place in about a 5-10 second timeframe. After stopping on the shoulder of the road I made note that the vehicle was showing a transmission problem, an emissions problem, an awd problem and I think just about every other issue light was lit up. I tried to get the vehicle back on the road, but it would not go any higher than 3rd gear and the dash kept indicating a transmission and awd problem. I pulled over again and turned the vehicle off and back on. At that point the only indicator light that lit up was the emission system problem (see attached picture). I reentered the interstate and the transmission was working properly again. We stopped at the next gas station and filled the gas tank and upon restarting the engine the emission light was still on. We carefully drove home at 65�70mph. The following day (Sunday), the emission light was no longer on.",  07/22/2017

2378,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Vehicle Speed Control,Vehicle Speed Control problems,"This is a follow up to complaint 10881962 in which one of my fears has come to fruition. I was driving my car in the normal mode (acc and lkas disabled) on a normal two lane paved road when the car in front of me made a slow right turn. I was not following very closely and came to a complete stop on my own to avoid running into the other car. I stopped about 15 feet away from the other car. The other car then completed the turn to the extent that the other car was no longer in the way of me driving forward in a straight line. When I pushed the gas to then proceed the collision mitigation system started flashing the ""brake"" message and producing an audible warning. At this point I was possibly going 10 mph again. After verifying that there was definitely not anything in my way, I kept applying the gas. My car then started braking on its own, at which point I pushed the gas harder to presumably over-ride the braking. A moment or two later, my car then made a sudden and hard brake on its own that brought my car to a complete stop, despite the fact that I was pushing hard on the gas. The other car that had turned was well clear of the lane by this point, and was easily 1 ft away from my path of travel when I started accelerating in the first place. My only explanation is that the collision mitigation system was confused by the lack of a shoulder lane marker (only a raise cement curb was present) and somehow thought the car was still in the ""road. "" in either case, the system malfunctioned to the point that my car was suddenly brought to a complete stop, and the car behind me very nearly rear-ended me in a situation where I had already come to a stop, and the obstacle in front of me had cleared / continued to become increasingly more clear of my path.

2384,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Service Brakes,Service Brakes problems,"The Pilot defaults to the automatic engine shutoff when the brake is pressed. Several times, my car would shut off at the stop, but not restart when I took my foot off the pedal. When I'd go to restart the car, pressing the start engine button would just turn on accessories - it would never engage the gas/ignition. I'd have to give it a few minutes. I took it to my dealership who replaced the push button ignition. I had googled the issue and saw others had the same issue and warning message about the brake mitigation system, I saw that it was likely related to the brake booster/vacuum hose. I brought it back to the dealer the following month as the shut off had happened again and explained again about finding the brake booster as the issue. They replaced the part and the stall out hasn't happened again. It was never a consistent issue. I don't know what caused it to shut off, as it happened in cold or warm weather. Having to press the brake really hard is not a natural step in driving, so I'm thinking there's something wonky with the system. Even when I remote start my car, I have to press the brake pedal extremely firmly to have it remain started when I go to drive. Otherwise, the car will just switch to the accessory mode. This is a risk because the car defaults to the auto engine shut off when in traffic. If a car is unable to restart when the brake pedal is released, accidents can happen.",  02/01/2021

Collision mitigation: - all of these trigger ""brake"" messages to be displayed, which is just 1 step before the brakes being auto-applied, which could cause me to be rear-ended. - false alarms while merging from lefthand onramps where a pending collision with the jersey barrier is detected - false alarms by the hills adjacent to the road when going around a sharp turn on back roads - false alarms when cresting a hill with a curve after the hill and it thinks an oncoming car will be hit, because it can't see the lane markings past the hill lane keep assist: - partially goes into exit ramps on its own if in the right lane, causing other drivers to think I am leaving the lane and start to merge themselves - is confused by lines of tar and will depart the lane on its own - often ""fights"" with the lane departure mitigation around corners - tries to prevent me from giving other vehicles some buffer when passing them, if they are wider or drifting toward me. - does not alert when it stops being able to detect the lines.",  09/01/2015

I had no unusual warning notifications or any unusual experience driving to and from the preschool. I parked the car in our driveway. Julian and I exited the vehicle, and walked to our front door. As we approached the front door I smelled smoke, and looked back at the car. I noticed a small flicker in the passenger side lower headlight. Upon closer look, I realized this was in fact a flame. Julian and I left our bags on the porch, stepped off of our front porch, and moved away from the house and car, and called 911. As we waited for the fire department, we watched this small flame grow to full flames, engulfing the engine, front hood, and front of the car.

2420,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Forward Collision Avoidance,Automatic Emergency Braking problems,"I purchased a brand new 2016 Honda Pilot ex. After the salesman pitch about adding top-notch safety, I paid extra for the Honda sensing package (include collision mitigation braking system) as it was not a standard in 2016. Currently my SUV has less than 14000 miles. The collision mitigation braking system (cmbs) has been warning and applying brakes when it should not for many years. Recently I drove on a highway that had construction for about 3 miles on a clear day. The car was the previous day and had nothing obstructing the camera on windshield or the radar behind the Honda badge. One lane was closed and there were flat surfaced traffic barrier (similar to cones) has been setup for the entire construction strip. About half into the construction zone, my SUV instrument panel had a warning that read ""collision mitigation system problem"". When I noticed the warning sign is not disappearing after restarting several times, I disconnected the battery and connected it after a day. The warning sign did not go away. Then I took the SUV to the dealer from whom I purchased the vehicle. They washed the car but the warning sign is still active. The warning sign cannot be turned off using the physical button for the cmbs on the dash. Searching through the internet, I see that this is common problem among Honda owners. Many owners who experience this issue report that when they took the SUV to the dealer, they reported that the cmbs was overwhelmed by the construction barriers and the only way to fix this is to recalibrate the cmbs at dealer that costs about $500. However, this is only a temporary fix until the SUV drive through a construction site. I purchased Honda sensing for the safety of my family. Instead Honda has provided defective system that fails when driving through a construction site. Construction sites are common occurrence in everyday driving. Honda sensing cmbs is a good money maker for dealers as they get to recalibrate the system for high fee.",  06/11/2022

I tried to drive it a few miles and it would not shift properly and I couldn't drive it more than about 20 mph. I had it towed from home to the closest Honda dealership. The vehicle had around 40k miles on it at the time. Honda said it's a known issue with a bulletin - stating that the cam shaft assembly needed to be replaced along with a sensor. They told me the cam shaft assembly was under the power train warranty but I had to pay for the sensor. When I did a little research, I found that Honda was giving extended warranties to newer models having the same issue and even doing recalls but my VIN didn't qualify. A few months down the road and my car started having shifting problems again. So, I take it in and they are saying the transmission needs to be serviced but the service only gets a little bit of the fluid out so they wanted to do the service 3 times and charged me for doing the same thing 3 times. After some research, I find out that it's a known issue that they are willing to give a limited warranty on up 80k miles. My concern is that I don't feel safe driving on the highway with shifting issues, stalls and jolts that have happened within 4 months of each other. If I were on the highway when that happened, going at 60 mph, it would have caused unnecessary accidents. It's dangerous but, still no recall for my vehicle and it's like fighting tooth and toenail with Honda to get them to do what is right. I don't know when or if it will happen again.

2444,Honda,Pilot,2016 Pilot,Suspension,Suspension problems,"I write to you to convey my safety concerns regarding a new Honda 2016 Pilot. My attempts to resolve my concerns with american Honda motor CO. , inc. Were met with tepid reluctance and a cavalier neglectful attitude. 1. At high speeds (55-75 mph) the vehicle oversteers and during emergency avoidance maneuvers becomes unstable. Twice while avoiding dear on interstate highways, I have almost lost control and was seriously concerned about rolling the vehicle over. I own and have driven a 2003 Pilot for over 180,000 miles and never experienced this sort of issue. I believe the suspension is incorrectly designed and that unexpected and unnecessary rollovers are imminent. 2. The ¿auto idle off¿ feature turns the engine completely off at certain times and under certain circumstances. It takes between 900 and 1,300 milliseconds to recover power to the wheels when this happens. Unlike hybrid vehicles (from which this feature was taken), there is no alternative electrical motor to provide torque to the drivetrain while the engine restarts and as a result, there is delay in accelerating. In the vast majority of times, this is of no consequence however in a small fraction this delay increases the risk of collision. About once per week, I experience a delay in entering dense traffic within short interstate merge lanes. This delay of about one second is enough to remove my margin of error and increases the risk of collision during a merging maneuver. While there is a switch to defeat this feature, it resets every time the vehicle is turned off and remembering to override it every time is inconsistent with human memory and performance.",  11/04/2015

I saw your news report that there is a document out there published by the NHTSA that is investigating this issue. I’d like to add my experience to this. On or about April 2022, we started experiencing the start/stop issue while living in kansas. When the issue occurred, an error message would flash very briefly across the dash, quick enough where we could not take a picture of the message. Our Honda would stutter then start back up. At this point, we took it to the legends Honda dealership [10050 parallel pkwy, kansas city, KS 66109] and after a free diagnostic they told us they could not a) replicate the issue, b) find evidence of the error message in the system. The next week, we had a complete engine failure while at a stop light for a full 5 minutes. During those 5 minutes, the engine remained off, the transmission shifted to park on its own, and the vehicle could not be restarted manually. Traffic built up behind and around us as we were trying to figure out how to get off the road and we could not turn the hazard lights on. It seems this issue is related to an electrical component. After 5 minutes, we were able to push the ignition button to turn off the car completely and restart the engine. The vehicle operated normally afterwards. On August 12, 2022, the same issue occurred where the vehicle engine would not restart and we were prevented from manually restarting the vehicle for about 5 minutes. Once again, the transmission shifted itself to park, an error message flashed across the screen briefly this time, and after 5 mins we could manually restart the car and continue as normal. Between these catastrophic failure dates, we would experience multiple start/stop stutters with error msg the only experience we have where this would not occur is to manually turn off the auto start/stop feature when driving the car. We see this as an issue that could cause injury, aggressive drivers, and other safety concerns.",  08/10/2022

It started with the engine occasionally ""hesitating"" to restart after I held the brake pedal down at a stop light. As it started to happen more frequently, I took it to my Honda dealer and they told me that they could not recreate the issue and thus could not diagnose and fix it. Within the last 6 months, the issue has become more and more frequent and severe to the point that I have been worried about the car not restarting and have been manually turning off the auto start/stop feature when I drive the vehicle. It does seem to occur more frequently in hot weather when I running the a/c and there is more of load on the engine and system. On July 16, 2022, I forgot to turn off the auto start/stop feature, and at the first stoplight that I stopped at, the feature turned on, shut off my engine and then failed to restart. I had to put the car in park and then it took me a few moments to get the car to re-start. The vehicle was very slow to respond, as I was afraid of the car not restarting at all. After a couple of minutes the car did restart. I turned off the auto start/stop feature and did not have any further issues on my drive home. After the failure to restart from the auto feature, my dashboard told me to put the car in park and restart.

Once the car restarted all warning lights disappeared. Upon returning home that day, I googled the issue before making an appointment with my dealer again.

Car zooming by me as my car was stuck in the turning lane. If a car failing to start as a result of a feature that was integrated by the manufacturer isn’t a safety issue then I don’t know what a safety concern would be classified as according the this institution. Permanently shutting off the feature is not an option as it renegades every time you start the car initially. The car has stalled a few times prior to today’s incident but this is the first time it failed to restart. As I drove home I reengaged the system to see what would happen, if failed to restart again and began the stall every time once the idol stop was engaged. This is unsafe. If I forget to turn off the function of this feature and I am on an expressway what happens if the car fails to restart, my brakes lights may not be pressed as I am thinking I am simply going to drive off and I could get rear ended at 60 miles an hour. This is a safety issue. This is a ticketing time bomb and further delays are putting thousands of lives at risk. I did I not know about the problem until I research the internet to find a solution.

2535,Honda,Pilot,2017 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"The auto start/stop feature on my 2017 Honda Pilot has had issues for the last 2 year. It started with the engine occasionally ""hesitating"" to restart after I held the brake pedal down at a stop light. As it started to happen more frequently, I took it to my Honda dealer and they told me that they could not recreate the issue and thus could not diagnose and fix it. Within the last 6 months, the issue has become more and more frequent and severe to the point that I have been worried about the car not restarting and have been manually turning off the auto start/stop feature when I drive the vehicle. It does seem to occur more frequently in hot weather when I running the a/c and there is more of load on the engine and system. On July 16, 2022, I forgot to turn off the auto start/stop feature, and at the first stoplight that I stopped at, the feature turned on, shut off my engine and then failed to restart. I had to put the car in park and then it took me a few moments to get the car to re-start. The vehicle was very slow to respond, as I was afraid of the car not restarting at all. After a couple of minutes the car did restart. I turned off the auto start/stop feature and did not have any further issues on my drive home. After the failure to restart from the auto feature, my dashboard told me to put the car in park and restart. I do not recall if any other warning lights appeared, as I was franticly trying to get car restarted in the middle of traffic and cars honking at me. Once the car restarted all warning lights disappeared. Upon returning home that day, I googled the issue before making an appointment with my dealer again. I became aware of nthsa's investigation into this issue. From my experience, Honda should recall these vehicles and fix the issue.

From experience I have found that I have to release the brake and push my engine start button a couple times to completely turn off everything then push the brake and button to start the car. A few times it I had to do that cycle several times before it actually restarted. Meanwhile I am in the middle of the road completely blocking traffic. My dealer was “unable to replicate” so my solution has been to turn off that feature. Unfortunately, auto stop/start is automatically on every time I start my car … so this happens when I forget to turn it off. There are times that it works and the car restarts but even then the electrical system shuts down. Radio turns off and back on as the car is restarting and dash lights turn off then on, which reminds me to once again turn the feature off.

Obviously, this is a very dangerous situation that could kill or maim myself or an occupant of another vehicle; the police officer who happened to own the other vehicle said I should not drive my vehicle until the problem is solved, which, of course, makes sense as my vehicle at present is unpredictable and dangerous. I have now taken the vehicle into the dealer, but I've found in the past these intermittent problems are difficult to diagnose. Should it not be diagnosed and fixed--I noticed that others have had this same vexing and dangerous situation, and it was not fixed or resoved to their satisfaction--I will no longer drive the vehicle as it is too dangerous.

Warning lights went off on the dash, but the car wouldn't restart for at least a minute both times. No warning lights were on the dash before the incident and after the car restarted, no warning lights remained lit on the dash. I took my car to an automotive store and had them check the battery, the alternator and the starter - all of these came back as being in perfect condition. I was extremely scared when both of these incidents occurred. One time I was at the bottom of an exit ramp of a busy interstate and the other occurred on an interstate in stop and go traffic. In addition to these two incidents, for the past 2 years, the car has been having issues after it idles down and then should restart and accelerate. About 2-3 times per month, when the car is stopped and has idled down, when I let off the brake and accelerate, the electrical system will flash on and off. The entire dash goes dark, the audio goes off and comes back on, etc. The entire electrical system reboots. When this happens, it does not impact the ability of the car to accelerate because it is more like a flash - the car doesn't die and have to be restarted. I am taking my car into the Honda dealer on Monday to attempt to diagnose the problem, but from the research I've done, may other Pilot owners are having the same problem and their dealers aren't able to find an error code caused by these issues.

2581,Honda,Pilot,2017 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"For roughly the last 4 months, my car stalls at a stop (stop sign, traffic light, etc) by shifting itself into neutral. The car has a push button gear shift and the warning light says to shift the car into park. Sometimes, I can shift the car into park and sometimes I can't shift the buttons at all. If I am able to shift into park, a message on my dashboard lights up and stays �to shift from p, engine must be running�. Either way, I have to turn my car off and back on again in order to be able to drive. The first time this problem happened, I called the dealer and they thought that possibly something got lodged in the gear shift. However, as time goes on, these events become more and more common. Our local Honda dealer had my car for roughly a week in June and tried to recreate the problem. They were unable to duplicate it and did a factory reset. That worked for about a month. Now, the stalling happens at least once a week and yesterday it happened three times in the matter of an hour. When I took the car to the dealer in June, it had also stalled three times in an hour. I feel at high risk driving the vehicle because cars get impatient behind me and start moving when the light turns green even though I can't move. Or, if cars are approaching a green light, they probably won't realize that I am unable to move making this a huge safety concern. This problem happens everywhere but on the highway.",  09/11/2020
2582,Honda,Pilot,2017 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"Honda knows that there is a problem with the transmission that causes the fluid to overheat. The overheating issue leads to a �judder� in the transmission. The car accelerates in a very jerky way especially between 30 and 50. This is a big safety issue if you are trying to pass someone. As soon as the vehicle reaches 80,000 miles Honda will no longer cover the so-called �repair� which is to flush the burnt transmission oil multiple times. This costs almost $400. Honda knows they have a defective transmission and, instead of fixing it, they are passing the transmission flush cost on to the buyers. A recall should be issued before someone gets killed trying to pass in a vehicle with a faulty transmission. Already happened twice on my Pilot.

2584,Honda,Pilot,2017 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"The auto engine idle (aei) feature has a flaw in it that Honda has apparently not identified or explained and it is a serious safety concern. Aei shuts the engine off when the car is in drive but fully stopped and, in theory, increases fuel efficiency by reducing engine idling when the car is stopped, e. G. At a stoplight or in stop-and-go traffic. While there is a button to disable it, this button has to be pressed each time you turn the car on and cannot be permanently disabled. We try to remember to always press the button and disable the feature but occasionally forget and don't realize we haven't disabled it until we come to a stop somewhere and the feature engages and the engine shuts off. Aei would just be a nuisance if it worked 100% of the time as it is designed to work but, unfortunately, it doesn't. When it works and the brake pedal is fully depressed, the engine is automatically idled, and then as you begin to lift your foot off the brake pedal, the engine quickly turns back on, you're already in drive, and you go. However, on what seems to be a completely random and unpredictable basis, sometimes when you begin to lift your foot off the brake pedal, rather than having the engine restart automatically, the entire car just goes dead. At this point, you have to frantically put the car in park and completely restart the engine. If you're lucky, this happens quickly and you're not stuck in a compromised spot with no one bearing down on you from behind but by its design you are somewhere you need and want to be moving from quickly, and it has happened at the exact moment when you try to accelerate. This has happened to both myself and my wife a handful of times in scary situations. Read all the other complaints on the internet - no service rep anywhere has an explanation.

During the last service for this issue (my car was out of warranty) and I was told it would cost almost $2000 to fix. They agreed to cover 75% of the cost as this has been a problem every year. Within days of leaving the dealership, the light came on again. The 2017 Pilot is a lemon. This is some fuel injector issue. It could cause a serious accident as the ultimate result of this issue is engine misfire. . . I have had moments of misfire when entering an intersection and could have caused a serious accident. There appears to be no permanent fix for this issue. This Honda just fixes it and it's not a big deal to the owner until you are out of warranty. This is incredibly frustrating. I love the car, but this is disappointing as I have the Pilot elite which is one of the most expensive cars they offer. The local dealership has been good about it. However, I fear the next time I return to complain about this issue, they may not be as accommodating.",  07/16/2020

Was informed they would have to keep car overnight so the valve clearance could be checked while car was cool. I have found that this problem has been ongoing for four years. It is unsafe and very nerve racking when your car dies through no failure of the driver and other impatient motorist sounding their horn because you aren't moving. One has to worry about one of those impatient drivers not paying attention to what's going on and hitting their gas pedal when the traffic light goes green and all of a sudden you are rear ended. Four years is long enough, even I realize that this problem didn't start with these cars until the introduction of the electronic computer shifting and the auto stop shut down process was introduced in these cars.

But I noticed that when I am driving in the highway at around 70 mph then apply brakes, the car shakes. I brought it back to Honda and they think it is the rotor and fixed it yesterday. The other new problem is the alarm that kept going off randomly when the car is parked and locked. When I picked up my car after the oil change a few weeks ago, the technician did not mention any problems with my alarm going off while my car was at the delearship. I went back to the Honda dealer for diagnostic test yesterday and they recommend replacing the keyless access control unit. This will cost close to $ 1000 diagnostic, parts and labor. I am told if I do not replace the control unit, the problem can get worse where my car won't start anymore. So I have no choice but replace it. So I brought my car just for routine oil change weeks ago and now I have problem with rotor and control unit that cost me $ 502. 72 yesterday and another $700 plus dollars to replace the control unit.

I could have been stranded in unsafe areas, thus impacting the safety of myself and family. There was no warnings before this happened the first time. Then, after changing the battery, it went another week without issue and then randomly happened again, without warning or indicators. It was looked at by 2 mechanics, the first (christian brothers automotive) could not find a problem. The second (Honda dealership) diagnosed it as “body control module failure-code b12d3”. They were not able to fix my car after diagnosing the problem today because they didn’t have the part in stock. So, I am now having to disconnect my battery every time I park to prevent it from draining the battery and honking.

Both times the vehicle was stopped and the feature that idles the car down to conserve energy was activated. When I let off the brake instead of the car restarting or gearing up and accelerating, the car just died. Warning lights went off on the dash, but the car wouldn't restart for at least a minute both times. No warning lights were on the dash before the incident and after the car restarted, no warning lights remained lit on the dash. I took my car to an automotive store and had them check the battery, the alternator and the starter - all of these came back as being in perfect condition. I was extremely scared when both of these incidents occurred. One time I was at the bottom of an exit ramp of a busy interstate and the other occurred on an interstate in stop and go traffic. In addition to these two incidents, for the past 2 years, the car has been having issues after it idles down and then should restart and accelerate. About 2-3 times per month, when the car is stopped and has idled down, when I let off the brake and accelerate, the electrical system will flash on and off.

When this happens, for a very brief time (too short to get a photo) warning lights related to the collision and/or emergency braking systems flash. After those lights go away, the dashboard lights indicate that the vehicle is in neutral (not by my doing) and that I must press the brake, put the vehicle in park, and restart the vehicle. This process does not always work the first time and the delay of turning off and restarting the car, even when it does work, causes a dangerous situation in traffic. When this happens on a downward hill, my vehicle rolls forward as it “dies” and I am sometimes stuck in the middle of an intersection as I try to restart the vehicle as quickly as I can. When it happens in heavy stop and go freeway traffic, I’m often surrounded by vehicles traveling at high speeds. I’m terrified that my baby and toddler will be hurt in this vehicle.

With that issue, we took it to great lakes Honda which changed the transmission fluid (great lakes did not flush the transmission) at 28,000 miles. On April 3, 2022, the transmission hesitation began again. I took it to apple tree Honda in arden, nc, (we had moved to waynesville, nc, in late 2021) on April 5, 2022, a technician found no error codes, but performed a transmission flush and fill. . My issue with this is that the transmission fluid should not degrade in 7,000 miles of normal driving, causing transmission malfunction. The vehicle does seem capable of towing a weight near the published owner's manual maximum of 3,500 pounds. With this interval, I am concerned that the Honda stated operational guidelines are false, and the vehicle’s transmission might continue to degrade as many other Honda Pilots’ transmissions have as reported by many owners. The apple tree Honda technician who worked on the Pilot, advised me to add an auxiliary automatic transmission cooler, which is necessary if towing more than 3500 lbs. Since the April service, I have not towed the trailer. I am fearful that the transmission will fail when I am towing the trailer.",  04/01/2022

I go to press on the accelerator as I normally would and it would not drive, so I pressed on it a little harder as I was turning left since there were cars approaching. My vehicle suddenly jolted, making myself and the kids shift/jump from the force. I then proceeded driving down the road and let go of the accelerator, and my SUV suddenly started to feel like it was slowing itself down instantaneously. It felt like it was trying to make the vehicle's speed go down to 0. I then pressed on the accelerator again to prevent it from happening, but it continued to do so whenever I let go. I had to stop at the school's parking lot and turn off the SUV completely. When I turned it on again and began to drive, it was functioning normally. Since then, it has happened about 3 or 4 times, 1 of which happened on the expressway, which was way scarier. I had to get out of the expressway as it was dangerous. Just yesterday, I had a separate issue with the SUV that may seem related in retrospect. My SUV did not want to turn on. I experienced all of the dashboard lights flickering, and being unable to start it. It was not the battery because at some times, the radio would turn on, the lights, and the windows/locks would function normally. I was unable to get the vehicle to go to neutral, or anything then on. When the lights were not flickering, it presented me with the Smart entry system light problem.

I took the vehicle home, then later that day I drove it approximately 17 miles to a racetrack that I work at part time. At 12:30 am, I was leaving to head home, and while idling in the parking lot, it had died yet again and took several minutes to restart. Once it did restart, I had no throttle response in park, neutral or in drive. I shut the vehicle off and restarted it with no other issues for the 17 mile trip back home. The dealership suggested that I take picture/video when it happens, which poses another safety concern to do that in the event I am driving when this event occurs. This is a severe safety concern as there is the potential for the engine to die/stall during a hard braking event in which I could lose power brakes.

I received a call from a service advisor at ourisman Honda on 11/4/19. He refused to acknowledge that there was a problem with the transmission and no repair was made. When I told him what happened, the service advisor stated that it is likely that the vehicle experienced a ""computer glitch"" and that simply restarting the vehicle would fix the problem if it happened in the future. I told him that it is a serious safety issue to have to restart a vehicle while driving. The transmission often exhibits a ""sticky clutch"", delayed gear shifting (sometimes as much as 2 seconds of delay before the gear is shifted), and often times a ""clunk"" is heard when the gear is changed.

Unfortunately during this first winter I have found out that this vehicle does not have a functioning heater. As soon as the weather turned cold I noticed that this new Honda Pilot did not have sufficient heat. While driving at highway speeds the heater functions ok but during city driving, or especially at idle, the temperature falls well below any acceptable minimum requirements. Below is a chart showing a comparison between a functioning heater in a 2014 crv versus this new 2018 Honda Pilot. Please note the differences in outside air temperatures: the crv measurements were taken at an outside air temp of -8� while the Pilot data was recorded with an outside air temp of + 8�. The vent temperature varies considerably based on the engine rpm. While accelerating the temperature is warm / hot but while driving in traffic or stopped the temperature can drop 80 degrees or more in 1-2 minutes. Based on this data, I made two separate appointments to have the Pilot serviced under warranty at my local Honda dealer. The weather on the 2nd visit was cold (-17 degrees f). They �verified the complaint� and found that the vent temperature from a fully warmed up engine was 28 degrees (yes, below freezing!). They said they have another Pilot in their shop that does the same thing therefore there is nothing wrong with mine and considered mine as functioning �normal�. They did not do any diagnostic work and refused to do any work, even simple work such as trying to flush the heater core or remove any air from the system. They stated that Honda put in an undersized heater core in the Pilot and therefore they were not going to waste their time trying to fix.

Steve from Honda said it was finally in error state and it was the amplifier. Steve had ordered a new 1 & put it in 9/8/22, I thought my problems were over. On 9/12/22; I dropped my daughter off at school, I was leaving but I had to stop for traffic. I was about to pull out when the dash starting flashing/lighting up & I couldn’t go anywhere. The car was in park and I was stuck. I pushed the car into drive, ect, but it wouldn’t go. I turned the car off/on to try to restart things but nothing. The brakes then locked up and I couldn’t do anything. I tried everything that I could think, I was blocking traffic not allowing people to leave from the school and cars from coming in. I called Honda rd. Asst. But they said I had no longer a warranty as I am at 30,000 but I thought it was 36,000 miles. They connected me to aaa which I had to pay out of pocket for towing. I called steve & my serv. Advr. Adam so they knew that I was going to towed in. I couldn’t get the vehicle to turn off or on after awhile. 2 hrs. Later; the tow truck had came, he had to jump start it to get it on his truck, he toke me to Honda. I waited over 4 hrs. But steve said battery was good, he ran errors but couldn’t find anything wrong except the back up camera had an error but it seemed as though he didn’t believe that is the problem. I could take it home but he said if his wife was having issues, he wouldn’t want her to drive it. I left it w/Honda, steve toke it hm. To see if it would do what it did for me. I honestly don’t want to drive it, I am scared; what if something worse happens or pay to be towed again. I didn’t want a new vehicle to deal with issues.",  09/12/2022

Two other separate incidents where the system failed completely: the car did not turn over after several times and just stopped. This happened on interstate 95 in traffic. I was unable to move for 30 seconds while tried to get the car started again. Honda refuses to do anything about it; their solution is to have me try to video tape it occurring, since there are no faults. I am not doing this every time I come to a stop with my 1 year old in the car. It happened again while my wife was driving; this time on an on ramp to i95 while she was yielding for traffic. Auto start stop engaged, then failed to start back up- all while at a temporary stop. She has no idea what to do as the car requires you to put into park and then try and restart the car. Those were the two most severe cases; according to Honda this happens after 5 attempts to start the car. The other time it starts before the 5th time but not immediately. There is electrical failures associated with this; including collision system warnings during restart. Honda will no do anything, will not even attempt to replace starter or battery or even quote me a price to fix. This is completely unsafe to drive and we will be looking to trade the car in. Too bad as this is a wonderful car. Honda has driven it several times (according to them) and are not able to replicate the issue.

Once they tested for battery and electrical system for power leaks and such, and though the car is only 3 years old, it is on it's third battery. I have had to regiment myself to disabling the feature, before driving, to ensure the issue doesn't happen in traffic again, as it could result in an accident.

2907,Honda,Pilot,2019 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"I am actually reporting two incidences, since the first (never reported) now appears to be related. 1st: in March 2022 (approx 35,600 miles on the vehicle), the vehicle completely shut down after attempting to accelerate back out of the auto-idle stop mode. I was stopped at a traffic light on a highway off-ramp in rush hour traffic. All of the warning lights and exterior lights started flashing and strobing in and out, but I also had no power of any kind for windows, radio, nothing. I was unable to turn on the emergency flashers, so I got out of the vehicle to redirect traffic around me while I waited for it to be towed to the dealership. They told me that by the time my vehicle got to them, that the battery was completely dead, and therefore there was no data or code. They told me that it had to be the battery, but they’d fully recharged the battery and it was all good. (covered under warranty) yesterday afternoon 9/27 I was at a stoplight, once again in auto-idle stop mode. I depressed the accelerator once the light turned green and the car would not move. I looked down and noticed that my car had shifted itself into neutral? it would not allow me to put it back in park and/or restart. By now I am trying to wave the people behind me to go around, when I look up and see there’s some kind of message scrolling across the driver’s display; something about a wrong gear? there were cars stuck behind me, so I was in a bit of a panic mode. I took a few breaths and tried again. I fully depressed the brake, was finally able to put the car back into park and restart the car. I am bringing the vehicle in for service tomorrow (I am now outside of warranty) after just having a comprehensive 40,000 mile service completed on sept 10.

2921,Honda,Pilot,2019 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"Auto stop start is erratically failing to properly restart the car after brake has been disengaged. After arriving at a complete stop, the vehicle will properly shut down when the driver’s foot is on the brake. When the driver disengages the brakes, the engine should promptly restart and the car will find itself already in drive so it can continue to move forward. Under certain unknown circumstances, the car will stall and not be allowed to restart. In order to continue, I needed to shift the car to park, turn the car off completely, and then restart the car. Only then can I shift the car back to drive and continue. This presents a safety issue since once the brakes are removed, traffic behind interprets this action to mean you will be traveling forward shortly. The restart is sometimes accompanied by a lurk which might be also considered as moving forward. This vehicle has not been in a accident and the dealer was not able to reproduce this issue. The issue seemed to occur shortly after another recall was performed for the fuel pump. Auto stop start cannot be permanently disabled and needs to be performed each time the car is started.

It can shut down at any time without warning and leave us stranded. Not being able to move into neutral in its self is safety hazzard especially with no hazzard lights. Price Honda (david) was very rude and brushed me off telling me no one is going to call me back over this. However their manager (craig) called me shortly after and even acknowledged the known issue and said could take years to recall. This is not ok and why wasn't any of this disclosed.

The engine attempts to restart itself after letting off the brake or after a set period of time, however after attempting to crank the engine, the car beeps and has to be restarted manually. When attempting to restart the car manually, the car will not start the next 2-3 attempts, and will eventually restart after multiple presses of the engine start button.

2956,Honda,Pilot,2019 Pilot,Power Train,Power Train problems,"When the engine is disabled the car can't be put into neutral by the operator. In my case, on 2/13/20 the starter malfunctioned at < 7000 miles-it has since been replaced. I was in a parking garage, and no structure trucks were available to tow from the spot the car was disabled. The plan was to put it into neutral and push it to the street where it could be towed. The owner's manual does not tell what to do. The dealer didn't know, either. If it's googled, a youtube video comes up, that identifies an oddly shaped device or bolt deep in the engine compartment. But even the aaa mechanic who came to the scene,with all his tools, could not get it to turn. I asked the dealership if there was any other way and ultimately they said ""no. "" they later told me, after doing some research, that Honda has a special tool, requiring three extensions, used to accomplish this during transport to the dealer. This seem quite unsafe. Obviously, cars can be disabled in many ways. Without a reasonably accessible means of putting the car in neutral, it cannot be moved in an emergency situation (for example, out of a lane of traffic). It definitely can't be done by an owner (unless, I suppose it's someone who has the ability to google during the emergency, finds the video, and has the special tool). Please note the car wash feature will not work because the engine has to be running for that. When I first brought this up, no one at the dealership knew anything about this defect. I have since learned that most cars have a shift lock override lever easily accessible in the passenger compartment, often on or near the shift console. In my conversation with the dealership,they say that 2020 Pilots and 2019 and 2020 passports also have this design. I do not know how many other vehicles are affected.

The lane in which I was driving (right) slowed down, so moved to the left lane. That lane was also slowing as I can see the cars in the front slowing down and stopping. My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy. When informed about this to Honda, Honda was referring to geico, that they will do the investigation. Geico says that its not their problem and Honda should do the investigation. As a common man I would like to have this problem investigated and necessary action to be taken. I see they subrogate each other, which is not correct. I'm not sure how many cars are running in this condition on the road. Please do take necessary steps to check on this.

The lane in which I was driving (right) slowed down, so moved to the left lane. That lane was also slowing as I can see the cars in the front slowing down and stopping. My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy. When informed about this to Honda, Honda was referring to geico, that they will do the investigation. Geico says that its not their problem and Honda should do the investigation. As a common man I would like to have this problem investigated and necessary action to be taken. I see they subrogate each other, which is not correct. I'm not sure how many cars are running in this condition on the road. Please do take necessary steps to check on this. I can give all the required documents, pictures and police reports in this regard. I need assistance in investigation of this accident and find out why the car did not respond.

Only then can I shift the car back to drive and continue.

The restart is sometimes accompanied by a lurk which might be also considered as moving forward. This vehicle has not been in a accident and the dealer was not able to reproduce this issue.

When this happens the orange brake warning shows up on my dashboard advising ""brake"" and my car jolts forward to strongly break. There has not been a recall on this issue, therefore, there has not inspection on my car specific to this issue. When this occurs it causes extreme panic on unawareness of what is going on. There is a threat of a crash behind me, especially when driving on roads 55 mph, when the car all of a sudden out of nowhere comes to almost a complete stop. Also, it extremely distracts me due to the suddenness of this issue without any perceived warning.

My local mechanic, as well as the dealership where I purchased my brand new 2020 Honda Pilot elite awd were unable to address the issue. Have been experiencing electrical failures associated with my aeis for about a year that have gotten progressively worse. At first, once disengaging from aeis at a red light (by releasing my foot from the brake pedal) the radio would shut off and switch back on, but to am radio. What seemed like a few months later, when aeis was disengaging, my whole dashboard went blank and I received a message to ""shift to park + restart engine"". I have tried to be diligent in turning off aeis immediately after starting my vehicle, but in the few times I have forgotten, and my aeis has failed, the dashboard goes blank and the car shifts to neutral (indicated by the red light becoming illuminated around n). My local mechanic looked at this issue in June of 2022, and said that my battery was only holding a 30% charge, so we replaced it. After my most recent Pilot engine electrical failure, I called Honda, and was advised to contact my dealership since I was still covered by the powertrain warranty (<60k miles). To have a vehicle stalled in the middle of the road, once on i75 in stopped traffic in downtown atlanta, is an obvious safety hazard. I was trusting Honda with my family's safety when I purchased my Pilot, but that trust has been lost. Today, November 01, the dealer told me my battery was bad; it's less than 5 months old, mind you. Went straight to my mechanic, they ran a diagnostic on my battery, and was told it's fine. Called Honda corporate and set up a case investigation today.",  10/27/2022

It seems to have gotten progressively worse and now happens whenever I forget to disengage the auto engine idle. One time in the spring of 2021, my husband had pulled into the intersection and was waiting for the chance to turn, only to find the engine stall and not respond to anything. It took a good almost two minutes of turning off the engine and trying to push the power button back on. It finally did turn on so we did not need a tow, but it was extremely scary to be in the middle of an intersection with a stalled engine. Subsequently the engine stalled a couple of times, briefly flashing an error message on the dashboard before shifting into neutral on its own and then indicating to shift into park. I have had the diagnostic test ($99) done at the Honda dealership (dublin, OH) and was told that they could not replicate the engine stall and that there were no error records recorded in the engine log. A few times, the engine seemed to hesitate like it was on its way to stalling after being in auto idle engine mode, but would start up when I released the brake. Today the engine stalled again when I was at a red light, briefly displaying an error mode and then shifting into neutral on its own again. I had to power off the car, and try the engine start push button a few times before it finally powered on. I am constantly worried about the engine stalling, which is not a pleasant experience.

3042,Honda,Pilot,2020 Pilot,Electrical System,Electrical System problems,"The Honda auto start stop system has been taxing my battery through daily use and creates unsafe situations. On more than one occasion, similar to the following, I have experienced the Honda Pilot stop the engine via the a. S. S. System. Upon releasing the brake, the system attempts, but fails, to come to ignition and the electrical system lacks the ability to start the engine, creating a need to re-start (or attempt restart). On 1 such occasion, my family was traveling through a city on the interstate. After driving on the interstate for a few hours we came to a stop light and stopped. At the green light, upon releasing the brake, the Honda Pilot attempted to start again and failed. The car went completely dead in the middle of a 4 lane interstate with my family inside. The car did not start again until the 3rd time attempting to restart the vehicle. Approximately 10 seconds later than intended, we were able to clear our vehicle from the interstate intersection. On normal occasions, such as the course of business with the Honda a. S. S. System, driving in situations that would be categorized as ""start/stop"" situations, the Honda a. S. S. System leads to stalled response and delayed lurching into traffic creating situations due to the delay in response. Multiple times this has been reported to my dealer. They acknowledge it as a ""battery"" problem. They test my battery per Honda warranty and tell me it ""passes"". They basically are just charging my battery and sending me out the door.

The second time, they had a Honda field engineer look at the car and replaced the entire dashboard harness system (July 2022). Then today, it began doing it again.

With my foot on the brake, trying to change the gear and trying turn off the car for about 3 minute in the middle of traffic with my kids in the car, eventually I was able to shut off the engine completely off. I immediately try restart the car to avoid a car accident. It put itself in n (neural) and the dashboard screen said “put it in p (park) and hit bottom to restart car. ” the car wouldn’t let me push anything. The power button did nothing and even if you pushed the p for park it stayed in n. The battery light immediately came on when this happened also. And went away as soon as it worked again.

It begins with ""pops"" & ""crackles"" and just keeps getting worse. Also, intermittently, you will get error messages or a blank screen which could be dangerous. The problem comes and goes which makes it even more frustrating. I have personally taken my 2020 Pilot elite (msrp near $50,000) into my local Honda dealer 4 times already. Ten days after the most recent ""repair"" it has started all over again. In the past they have admitted they really don't know how to fix it and just keep replacing harnessing and wiring. They want me to bring it in again for a 5th time. Why should I bring it in when they clearly have no fix? the Pilot was purchased from shottenkirk Honda (cartersville, GA) in may 2020 and currently has around 30,000 miles on it. . My father lives in another state and he asked his local Honda dealer if they knew of the issue. They quickly admitted they did and again, admitted they don't know how to remedy it. If you do any simple research you will see it over and over. You can start with this simple google search: Honda Pilot infotainment problems. As I said, I haven't found anyone who states it's been fixed permanently. I do appreciate the efforts and kindness of my local dealership (shottenkirk) but at what point will Honda step up and do something of substance to fix the issue or replace the vehicles? this, in my opinion, is not a ""shottenkirk"" problem, it is a ""Honda"" problem. I have tweeted Honda north America and Honda customer service and simply got a reply that says they've created a file and will look into it.",  09/24/2021

After about 1-3 minutes of unable to control the car, sitting in the middle of the highway, then I was able to shut off the engine completely, then restart the car. When it happens, the dash board would have the battery light on and commend would say “you can not start the engine, shift to park”, but it was on p, and I couldn’t shut of the engine anyway. It was not controllable. My car drives great normally and no messages would pop up on the dash board. I brought this issue to the dealership, left my car there for a total check. I even said I have it in video when it happened. They didn’t want to even watch it. They said the computer will tell them, so they don’t need to see my video. They returned with nothing wrong, they could not find the problem. Since they did not see anything wrong, there is nothing to repair. They ask me to bring it back next time it occurs so they will have it on record. They did not solve any problem for me. I was frustrated and worried when it would happen to me again.

This is an SUV with a large rear blind spot that cannot be viewed simply by turning your head especially if there are short/small objects below the view of the rear glass.

Upon releasing the brake, the system attempts, but fails, to come to ignition and the electrical system lacks the ability to start the engine, creating a need to re-start (or attempt restart). On 1 such occasion, my family was traveling through a city on the interstate. After driving on the interstate for a few hours we came to a stop light and stopped. At the green light, upon releasing the brake, the Honda Pilot attempted to start again and failed. The car went completely dead in the middle of a 4 lane interstate with my family inside.

On normal occasions, such as the course of business with the Honda a. S. S. System, driving in situations that would be categorized as ""start/stop"" situations, the Honda a. S. S.

For a few seconds when I let go of the brake peddle, instead of turning on from the auto idle shut off it just shuts off, then I press the gas and it turns on.

After about 1-3 minutes of unable to control the car, sitting in the middle of the highway, then I was able to shut off the engine completely, then restart the car. When it happens, the dash board would have the battery light on and commend would say “you can not start the engine, shift to park”, but it was on p, and I couldn’t shut of the engine anyway. It was not controllable. My car drives great normally and no messages would pop up on the dash board. I brought this issue to the dealership, left my car there for a total check. I even said I have it in video when it happened. They didn’t want to even watch it. They said the computer will tell them, so they don’t need to see my video. They returned with nothing wrong, they could not find the problem. Since they did not see anything wrong, there is nothing to repair. They ask me to bring it back next time it occurs so they will have it on record. They did not solve any problem for me. I was frustrated and worried when it would happen to me again.

Car flashes brake and sometimes brakes on its own when it detects an object along the side of the road or when a car may be approaching in the opposite lane or in a center turning lane. This has nearly caused an accident on two different occasions. Each time the lane we are in is clear and usually doesn't even have a vehicle in front of us. 2. When in cruise control the acc will detect a vehicle in front of us going maybe 2 mhp slower than our set speed and our car will abruptly slow down to about 10 mph below the acc set point. Then it detects there is clear distance to the vehicle in front and will abruptly accelerate till it again detects the vehicle and then repeats the same actions - abrupt slowdown - abrupt acceleration and so on vs. A gradual slowdown to match the vehicle in front speed and holding steady at that speed. I have set the distance detection to each setting and it makes no difference. 3. Lane keep assist is plain down dangerous. Tried to merge onto a busy highway with turn signal on and the lka would not let us merge and jerked the wheel back to the right and the vehicle abruptly hit the brakes when there was nothing in front of us. Nearly caused traffic behind to rear end us. 4. Hands free cell feature is not hands free if connected to apply car play. This was not what we were lead to believe at the time of sale. Honda has some serious issues with the Honda sensing and a recall is a must as these issues will eventually cause an accident and I have to assume already have.

This happened to me with my 3 children in the car twice on very busy (50mph) roads, and is incredibly dangerous. The second major issue I have noticed, but less frequently (about 3-4 times in the past 6 months), is that the auto braking system will randomly alert and apply the brakes while I’m driving down a straight road with no traffic in front of me! needless to say, terrifying. This thankfully only lasts a few seconds before I regain control of the car, but also incredibly dangerous. I am scheduling service with Honda to evaluate ASAP, but I have read *many* accounts of the exact same problem online and every single person says Honda has never been able to find any cause. Some say replacing the battery helps, others say the stalling issue remains after battery replacement. If we can’t solve this problem, or have the auto engine idle completely and permanently disabled, I will be selling this car very soon. 16,104 miles driven as of today.",  10/25/2021
3153,Honda,Pilot,2020 Pilot,Forward Collision Avoidance,Automatic Emergency Braking problems,Vehicle brakes automatically when operating at highway speeds when passing a vehicle that is either moving slowly or stopped in a turn lane waiting to turn left. Occurs when collision mitigation system is in both the on and off position and when cruise control is engaged and disengaged. This has occurred approximately twice a month since purchasing new in July of 2020. Vehicle also breaks when encountering an approaching vehicle on the highway while going around a corner when turning to the right. One time the vehicle behind me almost hit me and had to go onto the shoulder to avoid a collision. I reported this to the Honda dealer in the winter months and they said it was likely caused by road salt. It's now June and there is no road salt and problem is still occurring.

Most recently drove the car on a 560 mile trip, the collision mitigation system warning came on 5 times when there were no cars or obstacles in front of me. Hopefully NHTSA can apply some pressure on Honda to address this issue. It is very frustrating when you have problems with a new vehicle and Honda will not correct them.",  05/14/2021

The lane departure migration system was turned on. I did not use a turn signal. There was not a car behind me or approaching me in the opposite lane. The car started to warn me I was going out of my lane by shaking the wheel and flashing a brake/lane departure warning at me. I ignored it since I didn’t want to hit the pedestrian and continued to move into the other lane. Then the car took over the wheel, braked and brought me almost to a complete stop suddenly. If a car had been following behind me, I would have been rear ended. I no longer trust the lane departure warning system. If I forgot to use a turn signal on the highway or suddenly had to leave my lane on the highway to avoid a car or object, this system could cause a serious accident. Thank you!.",  04/05/2021

In sept 2020, Honda replaced the most module and said this would fix the problem. Several weeks ago, my infotainment system again went blank (3/6/2021), I had no back up camera or information. This fix obviously did not work. I took video on my phone. I took the vehicle to Honda, they would not look at my video and said that they needed to recreate it (3/26/21). They did nothing. I also got the following message several days later (3/12/21), ""unfortunately, com. Honda. Telephonyservice has stopped. "" I also showed this to the Honda service center, they said interesting, we have never seen that. They did not want my picture, and could not recreate, so they did nothing. The crackling/popping noise is also back after it was supposed to be fixed, with the Honda repair. They could not recreate this either, so they did nothing. 2. I have issues with the forward collision braking, auto sensing. I live in a rural area and when driving on two lane roads, head on to the other traffic the vehicle constantly brakes. When driving over two lane bridges, which I do often, it brakes several times a trip trying to get over the bridge. This is not safe. One time I was on 66 in va (1/27/21), at night, an 18 wheeler was coming off an exit ramp, I was in the right lane. The vehicle slammed on the brakes and dropped my speed approximately 20-25 mph for no reason. The 18 wheeler was still on the exit ramp. I was almost rear ended by the vehicle behind me. The brake sensing it too sensitive. I have taken it in for this, they could not recreate and told me to turn it off. That is not an answer. If a vehicle has safety options, we should be able to use them and not be told to turn them off! the 2020 Pilot has a lot of issues that are not being fixed.

Upon releasing the brake, the system attempts, but fails, to come to ignition and the electrical system lacks the ability to start the engine, creating a need to re-start (or attempt restart). On 1 such occasion, my family was traveling through a city on the interstate. After driving on the interstate for a few hours we came to a stop light and stopped. At the green light, upon releasing the brake, the Honda Pilot attempted to start again and failed. The car went completely dead in the middle of a 4 lane interstate with my family inside. The car did not start again until the 3rd time attempting to restart the vehicle. Approximately 10 seconds later than intended, we were able to clear our vehicle from the interstate intersection. On normal occasions, such as the course of business with the Honda a. S. S. System, driving in situations that would be categorized as ""start/stop"" situations, the Honda a. S. S. System leads to stalled response and delayed lurching into traffic creating situations due to the delay in response. Multiple times this has been reported to my dealer.

Each time has been after coming to a complete stop at a red light and sitting there for a couple minutes. Suddenly there is a beep sound and the engine shuts down.

3190,Honda,Pilot,2021 Pilot,Equipment,Equipment problems,"The driver side mirror is loose. This is due to a defective batch of mirrors sold in a large number 2021 Honda odysseys and 2021 Honda Pilots. Honda is aware of this issue. Other drivers are aware of this issue and the dealer has acknowledged this to me. At highway speeds, the driver side mirror vibrates and becomes unusable or distracting (I. E. Unable to focus on objects while changing lanes, etc. ) resulting in an unsafe driving experience. Bringing the car back to dealer results in them taking the mirror off, putting on more glue, and reattaching. This works for 1-2 months until the glue becomes loose again. According to the dealer, Honda has not come up with a permanent fix but does is not willing to install an entirely new mirror assembly. I believe this mirror issue justifies a recall for all defective vehicles and a permanent fix which may include an entire new mirror assembly if a permanent glue on the mirror actuator cannot be used.",  07/01/2021
