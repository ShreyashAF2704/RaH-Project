My key would not go in the ignition after trying over and over! When it finally did wiggle in there, I drove to the Honda place. It’s not right to take advantage of people who don’t know any better! Seven hundred hundred dollars is almost as much as my pension after taxes! I will never go back to Holmes Honda in Shreveport, Louisiana! This problem should be a recall now that they know what causes it, but I guess they would rather keep ripping people off than doing the right thing!				- Paulette S.,				Shreveport, LA, US"

I had to fork out a whopping $500 to the dealership to get it fixed. I shouldn't had to have paid anything since it's such a common issue with this particular vehicle.

I got stuck in a parking lot luckily and not somewhere worst. it was late at night and took a cab home with my son. It's a $550 fix that Honda believes is due to wear and tear. Can I ask how can that be for turning a switch on a car? There are numerous complaints on the web relating to this issue and Honda should do a recall. In the meantime, I had an auto starter placed therefore they cannot program it back and, and, and too boot, I have to have two keys. the old one to open the door and the new one to start the ignition. The inconvenience is truly a factor in this matter and for all the complaints that Honda received and all of the lives they have impacted with this issue would you think they would try to resolve it and/or at least pay for a portion of the fix??? hmmm...no.				- mjan,				Quincy, MA, US"

12,Honda,Pilot,2003,interior accessories problems,Ignition Switch Problem,Pilot,Automatic transmission,"150,000 miles","I have been having problem with the key and ignition. The key will go into the ignition but won't turn. Which means you can't turn the car on. I had it towed to the dealership back in 2013, which they fixed the 2013 recall part for the ignition. Unfortunately, the recall for the ignition didn't cover the tumbler or the key. The dealership wanted over $1000 to fix it. I had the car towed back to my address and the tow company put me in contact with a locksmith that was able to re-key and fix the tumbler for less than $200 dollars. Now the problem has arisen again with the key and ignition. The key goes in the ignition but will not turn so the car can go on. I had to call a tow truck. Luckily, after an hour of sitting in a parking lot with my son, I retried to see if it will work and it did.

I am afraid that one day I will get stranded. I noticed that several people have reported that Honda will charge about $500 to fix this problem. That is a rip off to say the least.

19,Honda,Pilot,2003,interior accessories problems,Ignition Switch Problem,Pilot EX V6,Automatic transmission,"200,500 miles","Early 2014 we began having trouble with inserting the key into the ignition and turning the ignition to start the car. It began sporadically and escalated to frequently. By removing the key and reinserting it, the ignition would eventually turn. During this period, my husband backed the Pilot on to our drive (which is a hill). Some how, with the car still in reverse, he was able to turn the SUV off and remove the key. Fortunately it was in reverse on the hill, it would have rolled into the street otherwise. About a week later I discovered there was a recall for the ignition switch shift interlock for ""certain"" 2003 Honda Pilots that included ours. I found information on nhtsa.gov website that stated repairing the ignition switch interlock and any part of the ignition switch that was necessary. On May 2014 the recall was repaired. We thought this remedied the problem (not being able to turn the ignition). It didn't. 'n September 4, 2014, after inserting the key into the ignition, not only would it not turn, but the key was stuck. It wouldn't budge! Had the car towed to Honda dealer and was told that it was unrelated to the recall that was repaired in May. The Key Tumbler of the ignition switch had failed. I contested their conclusion based on Campaign #12V573000, that states replacing the ignition switch interlock and any other parts of the ignition as necessary. on the nhtsa website because the ignition key tumbler is a part of the ignition. They denied it. It I'll cost us $520 to repair.				- Ronald W.,				Cincinnati, OH, US"

Instead, I have suffered continual neck problems and have had to use pain medication and to seek physical therapy as well as consultations with doctors. Honda should recall this car and fix this problem - most cars have movable headrests and you can adjust them to provide adequate protection from whiplash. In addition, the seats are concave and the driver is forced to sit pitched forward in the seat since your back sinks into the seat back; this exacerbates the danger to the driver's neck in the event of rear end collisions.				- Andrew W.,				Gaithersburg, MD, US"

You can see in the photo the two connection areas have torn, causing the cables to fall out both sides. The other plastic piece is also broke, one of the glides snapped off. Very upsetting because the Dealer quoted me $500 to fix, or I can do it myself but I need to buy the entire system for $236 plus tax. I don't need to replace the whole system, nor would I want to anyway. There is a lot of tedious work to fixing this. It is absolutely ridiculous to not sell the lever separately and force the customer to spend $236-$500 and buy the whole cabling system, just to replace the small plastic part that is the product of Honda's bad design. No way that lever, that pulls metal cable, at a significant torque should be made of plastic! I don't have to be an engineer to see that. I have read this issue in many places on line so I'm not the only one. Now I cant use the vehicle's cargo compartment like planned.Update from Jan 28, 2013: Instead of paying the $236 for the part or $500 to have the Dealer fix it, I decided to fix it myself.  I glued and bolted a thin piece of metal I snipped to shape from a scrap metal 2x2 to the outside surface then redrilled the hole and channel for the cable to lock in place.  All works just fine and since the metal cable is now in contact with metal, not plastic, I dont anticipate the same problem to happen again.  So far so good anyway.   				- mmoyer,				Cleveland, OH, US"

I said it was his to do with as he pleased since Honda wasn't honoring their warranty or playing fair with the recall.I will probably NEVER buy another Honda.I have a Honda Civic 2002 NGV with their disastrous CVT which is a complete abortion of a transmission. I have a lot of problem with the danged thing not going into gear when it starts in the morning and I have to rev it in gear to get it to bump into gear.I noticed that Honda is putting the CVT in their new hybrid cars. Why? Why can't Honda build a decent transmission??? Every Honda I have ever had had a transmission issue.They also have the WORST warranty of any vehicle in their class. My next car with either be Hyundai or a KIA.I wish someone would sue Honda's ass off for all these consistent transmission problems and this corporate game they play with acting stupid or ""We've never had that problem with a Pilot before""...which is just complete nonsense.				- rover26,				Riverside, US"

The shop is recommending a used transmission, however, the 2003 Honda Pilot transmissions have been noted with a history of problems. To replace a used transmission with no warranty, we could be looking at this problem all over again in a short amount of miles. The 2003 Pilot had a recall issued in April of 2004 as a result of a safety-related defect existing and wishing certain operating conditions, the result is heat can build up between the countershaft and secondary gears in the automatic transmission. The memorandum from Honda goes on to indicate the in higher mileage vehicles, the is condition can result in gear tooth chipping or gear breakage can occur. In most cases, transmission noise will indicate a problem, however, it is possible for the transmission to become locked without warning.				- Suzie S.,				Westfield, IN, US"

The force of the slide eventually jammed the wheels sideways causing the car to hop as it propelled forward. Cars flew by on the left and right. Finally, my car stopped slamming me backward in the seat.The tow truck driver told me, “Good job keeping your car under control, many people are unable to do that. The last call I went on when this type of a thing happened, the car rolled three times and the driver was hospitalized in critical condition.”Upon having the car examined at Bill’s Tech Trans Inc. we were informed that we had a faulty transmission. At that time, we were unaware of a recall on the transmissions for 2003 Honda Pilots.Update from Sep 9, 2016: Honda has repeatedly asked for copies of receipts and invoices, which I have sent. Now, after all this time, they want me to send all receipts for services on the vehicle (oil change, tune-ups, etc...) for determining whether they will reimburse me for the failure of the transmission. A transmission deemed faulty by the United States government has nothing to do with the services rendered on the vehicle.

Eventually we realized the transmission was slipping, and I found a local mechanic who is familiar with the problem and suggested a full replacement. The estimated cost it $3000. I have already put $600 into it plus another $400 in property tax to get the tag. Unlike most others in the thread who have purchased their Pilots, I inherited mine and have only put $1000 in it so far. I can't afford to get a new car, and so I am taking a calculated risk that the new transmission will give be enough use to approach 200K with this car.Unfortunately I sold my perfectly good Honda Civic (2002) last week, just before realizing I needed to dump 3 grand into this Pilot to make it safe, to make it work. Up until this transmission problem with one of Honda's premier vehicles, I considered myself a ""Honda person"" who would always drive a Honda. After this expensive (and dangerous) problem, however, and considering the fact that this is a rampant problem that Honda is not addressing, I have dropped Honda from my list of trustworthy automobile manufacturers. I will spend the money to repair the transmission on this car because of the circumstances mentioned above (it came to me freely), but once I am done with this Honda, I will not consider this brand of auto when I make my next vehicle purchase. I buy cars and drive them at least 10 years; I'm not a person who leases and changes cars every 2-3 years. Honda's studied silence on this issue is the one and only reason why I am scratching Honda off of the list of potential car brands in the future. I'm sure they do realize what bad business this is, but they have probably calculated and decided they profit more by maintaining silence about this issue. Goodbye Honda.

Now the light is back on and I have noticed that upon acceleration at higher speeds it seems as though transmission is slipping and when I ease off and reapply it usually will engage but the RPM gauge rises much higher than usual, upon doing so and the vehicle seems sluggish.I am original owner and bought new from Orr Honda in Texarkana, TX and all the recommended service and repairs have been done. Upon researching I have found numerous complaints of this and some very nearly resulting in crashes due to sudden loss of speed and tranny slipping out of gear. It has been suggested that this in fact is originally an electrical issue that leads to a more serious mechanical problem if it is left unaddressed but apparently the patch job and recall Honda issued on this model Pilot in 04 NHTSA ref # 04v176000 was inadequate and this model, and possibly others, have a very serious and costly design flaw that Honda refuses to acknowledge and should be held accountable for and made to issue another recall and replace these faulty transmissions and torque converters. However, one forum post recommends replacing the 3rd & 4th gear switches on the tranny at first sign of a problem as well as a complete fluid flush which entails 3 drains and refills and also to thoroughly inspect the lines running to them that control the flow of fluid to all parts of the tranny. I am attempting the less invasive things first even before going to Honda dealership. I called Honda America and was told the recall on my VIN was done and that any further issue with it would be at my expense. Well, we'll see about that. If these less invasive attempts to solve this do not work I intend to take all of this information to an attorney and request class action suit for the obviously faulty and dangerous issues that are posted on the internet on reputable sites, which state have cost consumers out of pocket, sometimes thousands of dollars that Honda should in fact pay for, just like the design flaw they finally had to own up to on the faulty air bags on some of their vehicles, mine included. Sounds like a lemon law thing only most, but not all, of these cars are just out of manufacture's warranty and/or extended warranty but well under what is expected one should get on properly serviced transmission on a Honda.

113,Honda,Pilot,2003,transmission problems,Transmission Failure,Pilot LX V6,Automatic transmission,"97,000 miles","I purchased the 2003 Pilot in 2002, after owning 4 previous Honda products, expecting to drive this until I had 200,000 miles on the odometer, just like all my other Honda autos. In December, 2009, after driving the car from Dallas to Santa Fe and back, I noticed some minor slipping of the transmission and took it to the dealer. They did $1700 in repairs, indicating that this was the least costly solution. I wish I had checked online to see that this was a common issue with this model year; I would have chosen replacement of the transmission at that point and saved myself these costs. A few days after picking the vehicle up, I was back at the dealer, and they replaced the transmission with a Honda rebuilt one, adding approximately $5K to the cost and providing a 36K warranty. In August, 2012, while driving down I-40 in New Mexico, the engine light again came on, and other than that sensor light, the car had been driving just fine. I took it to dealer in Santa Fe within a few days of the sensor indicator coming on. The dealer indicated that a new transmission needed to be installed. I was amazed that another transmission was required after less than an additional 40K in driving. I have been driving it with no apparent issues since August, waiting to return to my Dallas dealer. Took it in this week there, and they indicated that it does require a new transmission. It was just over the warranty's mileage so the dealer attempted to have Honda provide some replacement assistance. Honda NA indicated that it was out of warranty and there was nothing they can do. I called them directly, telling them that this is the 5th Honda in my family, that I ""sell"" Honda's to all my friends and family, and that I have converted several friends and family members to driving these. Most of the mileage on this auto is highway miles and I have all the necessary service done at the proper intervals. I have a friend who purchased a 2005 Pilot who has had no similar issues. The customer service rep at Honda NA indicated that if it were up to him, he'd just keep driving until the car had serious transmission issues, which is what I will probably do. Based on the lack of support from Honda on this issue, this will be my last purchase of their product, unless they really come through with a deal on a replacement vehicle or repair/replacement assistance. As someone who works daily in providing excellent customer service in the financial services industry and who always keeps our Customers in mind when resolving a situation, I am deeply disappointed in this situation. We need to have the auto industry regulated as much as the financial services industry now is. Where is the auto industry equivalent of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau? I detest additional government regulation, but when a company refuses to support their Customers-for-life, I believe additional regulation is necessary.I am perplexed as to why Honda would choose to send a Customer to a competitor when they probably have 4-5 more future purchases of their products at stake. All auto makers are building quality products and Honda no longer has the edge in product quality and reliability. They will regret this decision at some point in the future. I will never purchase a model during it's initial release year. I can't help but wonder if the recall on the transmission is not a huge part of these future issues that people on here have indicated.				- Mark J.,				Dallas, TX, US"

127,Honda,Pilot,2003,transmission problems,Torque Converter Is Making Noise,Pilot EX 3.5L,Automatic transmission,"108,000 miles","I bought the 2003 Honda Pilot on 1/30/2003. I received the transmission repair recall and had the work performed on 5/4/2004. So I drove my Pilot for a little more than 15 months with some unknown issue that I assumed was properly and completely solved by Honda. Of course, I had no second thoughts about this because I implicitly trust Honda because of their earned reputation and my personal experience over the years. As I now understand the problem, there were over 100,000 of these transmissions that were produced and driven with this fairly critical engineering defect. The defect was allegedly repaired with a retrofitted part but in actuality the period of vehicle operation and the mileage accumulated before the recall repair causes the torque converter to overheat and become mechanically compromised by a lack of properly distributed transmission fluid. So, if many miles were driven before the recall repair was performed, the transmission most likely failed early in it's expected life span. If less time and/or fewer miles were driven, there would be a better chance of greater transmission longevity before failure. So in fact there are multiple levels of failure, but there appear to be two primary issues. 1. Honda has not honored it's warranty responsibility, by at minimum pro-rating the repair/replacement costs to their customers for faulty engineering and negligence of proper communication of expected operational failure. 2. More serious is the possible nature of transmission failures and the potential danger that Honda is placing its customers in. I am not an automatic transmission expert but when I read the accounts of many other Honda owners with the same year vehicle and same transmissions that had the same symptoms as mine, but continued to drive their cars to have the transmission blow up or in some cases seize while being driven. I am seriously concerned as to the position of potential danger that Honda is placing me! What do I do next? The Pilot has been an excellent, reliable and highly revered vehicle in our family. We always sing its praises because it has easily been the best car in my 44 years of driving 15 cars and trucks (VW Bus, Datsun 610, Honda Civic, MG-A, Chevy C-10, Chevy C-60, Ford F-250, Audi Coupe Quatro, Dodge Dakota, Ford F-450, Isuzu W-4, Honda CRV, Honda Pilot, Scion xB, and Ram ProMaster), the Pilot has been the best performer and still looks and behaves like a new vehicle. It has almost 109,000 miles and recently received some major replacements - timing belt, water pump, belts, plugs, rotors, pads, brake fluid, coolant, headlight assemblies, tires and of course synthetic oil from day one. I thought she was ready for the next 100,000 miles and now I find out that I'm in for major transmission work or replacement for roughly totaling $5,000 because Honda isn't owning up and being legit about an engineering flaw and the repair costs that many of its customers have been shouldering for years, depending on the mileage that their vehicles accumulated before the recall repair was completed. I am really disgusted that Honda has been apparently ducking this problem for years, hoping it would go away, although I understand that if you call up and beg, they will pay up to half the 'in house' cost of repair. So, if you bought the Pilot for $29,270.00, it really cost you $31,770.00, or if you fail to convince the Honda phone rep of your plight, it will have cost you $34,270.00, plus towing, of course your time and possibly your life, because Honda doesn't want to admit their error. Well if you have read this far, you see that I have owned a '77 Civic CVCC, a '97 CRV, and the '03 Pilot. I was waiting for the '16 Pilot, but probably not, with the poor response to the ongoing air bag disaster, I have to say that Honda's solid reputation and stellar ethic for honesty, quality, safety and service is crumbling or worse. I want a safe car! I mistakenly thought I had one for the last 12 years! I just looked at The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety website (http://www.iihs.org/iihs/ratings/TSP-List) and Subaru has the most Top Rated (5 in all) vehicles of any manufacturer - more than Volvo! I'm afraid it's time to steer clear of trouble (HONDA) and put myself behind the wheel of something with proven safety,value, reliability and straight forwardness.				- corboulee,				EAST HAMPTON, NY, US"

Ran the VIN number on Carfax, made sure the recalls were addressed, took it to a mechanic before completing the purchase and he said all is well with it, so great, paid 10K cash and was on my way. Did all the proper maintenance (oil changes, new timing belt, new tires, new battery) ... A year later I start getting the intermittent torque converter rumble strip noise between 40 and 50 miles per hour. The intermittent ruble strip noise sounded more like air gushing underneath the car (without any shaking). Here is a video on youtube that describes it exactly: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dN7QJEyxc24 ... been driving it that way since the end of 2011, until recently the noise is fairy constant. I can't drive in ""D"" without it happening (do not have a flashing D on dashboard YET). I drive it in D3 to avoid the rumble strip sound until I go over 60 mph, then I shift it into D. Mechanic said I'm ultimately going to need a new transmission and it's going to cost around $4500. I now have 130K miles on it, new $900 tires, new $750 timing belt, and not sure I want to dump money into this piece of sh*t after reading all of the complaints about this year Honda Pilot. It'll be the last Honda I own, as other people here have come to that conclusion as well. The ""fix"" Honda had for it's transmission issue was a too-small, cheap band aid, which left Honda owners having to carry the cost for their fukkup. I'm $11,763 into the Pilot (price of car, timing belt, tires, and new battery), have driven it almost 5 years without any other issues and have loved the car aside from this issue, but I can't see spending $4500 in confidence that this will last me much longer. I plan to just drive it into the ground for as long as it'll last me. Won't give a dime to Honda, ever.

At first his little road trip went well he didn't hear any sounds from the transmission and everything was fine & he's just going to go take the pilot to put gas in it.  He gets to the light to turn left on a busy intersection,  stops, when it's his turn to go, well, the pilot decides that it doesn't want to go.  Every time he tried to shift into drive the car would shut off. Meanwhile, the intersection traffic is trying to go around him.  We are both very lucky that no one had hit him, the car quit working almost in the complete way of on coming traffic.   Luckily,  a city police officer happened to be near by and stayed with him till I was able to get the tow truck for him.  The fear of my husband getting injured from this situation had me rushing to get to where he was.  My heart was racing,  everything else seemed a blurred now.  I was incredibly afraid for his life.  Thank you god for watching over my family.  Calling around to many places to find an affordable way to fix the transmission seemed endless.

Other cars that I owned in the past included Volvo, BMW, Mercedes Benz and Volkswagen. The best service I had from all the vehicles that owned was from the Honda's and it gave me a sense of comfort when I bought the Pilot. This SUV performed very well over the past 12 years. My wife and I are both gentle drivers borne out by the fact that we got 160,000 kilometers (100k miles) from the first set of brake pads. At the time of replacement the rotors were still in perfect condition and did not need any machining. The car is still running on the original Good Year Integrity summer tires, which have done close to 90,000 kilometers. One cannot get this kind of mileage when you are a hard driver. I was planning to drive the Pilot for 20 years!A year after I bought the Pilot we received a recall notice for a potential transmission problem. I took it to the dealership that did the necessary work. There were subsequent recalls including one for the ignition switch that we did not receive, due to the fact that we relocated to another city and the notification never reached us. The ignition switch/lock failed and the SOB’s at the local dealership did not bother to inform me of the recall and happily charged me $500+ for the new switch/lock. Well that is water under the bridge now as I only learned of the recall pretty recently.Recently the transmission started acting up by becoming jerky and at times it would not engage third gear. The engine rpm’s would also increase a bit between changes. I took it to the local dealer who withheld the recall information on the ignition switch/lock and they suggested we do an oil and filter change. $139 later I was on my way again with a bit of an improvement. At least the gears changed without missing any changes, yet the engine still revs up a bit between changes and the gear changes are very jerky. I decided to visit some online forums to find out if other Honda owners are experiencing similar problems. That is when I came across this site – wow! With all the lemon tranny’s in the Accords, Odysseys and Pilots, I am absolutely appalled by the action of local dealer, Carlton Honda, who played ignorant and suggested the process of problem elimination. Step one was to replace the transmission fluid as per their suggestion. Who knows what else they would do to extract more money from me for something that is clearly a Honda design problem. A problem that they should be fully aware of! They will be hearing from me now that I have an arsenal of information to confront them with.

If you ease off the gas the shudder will stop. It only lasts for a few seconds, but it is very noticeable shake. We have been told that the transmission needs to be replaced.

Minutes later, it happened again so we exited the freeway and continued slowly. Once home, there was a hesitation when shifting to reverse and it actually rolled forward for a few feet. We could hear it slip into gear after a few seconds with a metallic ping or thud. The next day, we noticed the gears slipping when accelerating around 40 mph. Took the car to renton Honda and they surmised it could be bad gasoline. After paying for a diagnostic test, they determined a new transmission was needed at a cost of $3500 (with a goodwill discount). This car was purchased brand new, has never towed anything, and has had every scheduled maintenance at the dealership. This is why they offered the discount.

Lucky for me I was in my driveway when this occurred. Unfortunately I had blocked in the other cars in my house hold. The key would not come off of 0. So not only could I not remove the key but I also could not get the car out of park to move the car out of the way. I had to call a tow truck and they had to drag the car onto the bed and basically bounce it off once it was at the dealership. I saw that there was a recall on the ignition switch so I asked Honda about it and they said that there was a recall but not for the key getting stuck, it was for the opposite issue which was the key being able to come out while not on 0. When there is a recall on a part shouldn't that part be replace no matter if it has the issue or not. I asked if the recall had been done and they said I was current but could not provide proof that the defective part had been replaced. This is coming from a certified dealer so they have to be right, right? They then said because the issue was the opposite reason than the recall even though it was the same part that I would have to pay 600 to get a new ignition switch with new keys which would only work on the ignition and not the doors. The key that was in the ignition was the only key that I had because the same dealer lost the other set and would not make a new one without me paying for it. I had already signed on the dotted line so what did they care. They could not get the key out of the ignition which I now had to pay for a new copy for the door key. This is a reoccurring issue and a defective part is a defective part and should be replaced without question.

CHECKED THE OIL ON MY DIPSTICK AND IT WAS BONE DRY. Called the Honda Dealer, who has serviced my car on a regular basis since new (like the 3 other Honda vehicles I've owned since 1986). I had it serviced with an oil change 6 months ago back in December 2013 (about 7100 miles had been driven since the last oil change they did). They told me to have oil put in it or TOW IT IN and not to drive it without oil (as if I was a bonehead to do that).I put in one quart of premium 5W-20 oil, turned on the engine for 5 seconds to see that the oil pressure light was off, then turned it off to check the dipstick again. THE DIPSTICK WAS STILL BONE DRY. Added a 2nd quart of oil and did the same thing. Oil was seen about 1/4 inch above the end of the dipstick but still below the low mark hole on the stick. I looked under the car to see if I was loosing oil. Then I checked the dipstick 10 minutes later to see if more oil had settled in the pan. NOW it was 1/8 inch from the end of the stick, LOWER THAN BEFORE. Thinking I had a massive leak, I called Progessive Insurance to have my car towed into the Honda Dealer.The Honda Dealer did an inspection and an oil and filter change and told me that they found no oil leaks of any significance. They also told me that it's OK for Honda engines to burn a quart of oil between oil changes.Well I knew something was wrong with that statement since I, my father, and my two brothers have owned Hondas for years. My 1986 Acura Legend didn't burn oil until it reached 190,000 miles and only about a quart between oil changes.

This vehicle had approx 93500 miles on it when it was replaced the first time and now three years later has 140,939. I have been told by Honda customer service that the mounts are warranted for 12 months. The vehicle is used by my wife to drive 20 miles roundtrip to work and on our trips. The vehicle is not used for towing and is not equipped with a tow receiver. Additionally, the ignition switch was improperly designed with a split wafer mechanism which according to the dealership and two local locksmiths wears out prematurely and causes jamming of the ignition cylinder as well as wedging of the keys in the ignition cylinder. Lastly, when a transmission recall was done on the car in 2005, it was done improperly. The recall specified a oil jet be installed on the transmission to lubricate the 2nd gear. The problem is that the hose used to connect the transmission fluid supply line to the transmission used a straight transmission hose which had to be bent 90 degrees in a distance of approx 2 inches to be installed. This causes the hose to be kinked and restrict the flow of fluid. Honda won't correct the problem or acknowledge the repair should have incorporated a formed elbow hose instead of a straight hose to ensure proper flow. Now Honda is telling me they don't have a representative in New Mexico that I can speak to about the above issues.

We used this for about a year with no problems. We tried the inverter one more time and without even connecting the dvd player, the SRS light came on. This inverter was powered under the limit labeled on the cigarette lighter.

But now we are afraid to try again since we got a firm warning from the technician that we aren't supposed ot use inverters in the lighter and if this happens again, they won't cover it!

It is incredible difficult for me to get the children in the third row buckled because the seat belts are constantly getting ""stuck"" and have to be rethread all the way back. This is difficult because they get caught on the boaster seats that then have to be picked up and moved around to get the seat belt off. Also, the seat on the seat on the passenger side is too narrow and the seat belt buckles very low, close to the seat and it ends up underneath the boaster seat. These difficulties make it nearly impossible for my preschoolers to buckle by themselves and forces me to climb back in their seat to fix the seat belts and move the booster seat forward to buckle them in.

We went over a large pothole and the back end of the car bounced so hard it hit the highway and scraped. The steering immediately got wobbly, and I slowed down quite a bit. I figured the pothole probably damaged a wheel or something similar. The Pilot had been in the shop 3 days before getting some brake work done, and I'd had the tires rotated less than a week before at a local Belle Tire. The Pilot started swerving back and forth if I went above 40 MPH, so I turned around at the next exit and drove home. I called our mechanic and asked them to look at it. When we got there, they immediately put the car up on the hydraulic lift. Then they said, ""You need to come see this."" In 15 years, they've never called me into the shop to look at my car. They showed me where the bolts that hold the rear tire assembly to the frame had pulled out of the frame. The bolts were still bolted to the frame bits, but the frame was rusted out and flaking off. They said the car was done; there was no way to fix this. They were surprised I was able to drive it in to the shop. The Pilot had 160,185 miles on it and was 14 years old. There was very little rust on the easily visible parts of the car. The engine and trans were in good shape, and the interior was in good shape. I'd just spent $1,200 getting the brakes fixed, and the mechanic had not noticed anything wrong. In the photos, you can see how low to the ground the back end pieces are--the muffler was occasionally scraping the road as we drove home, and the tires were at an almost 45 degree angle. I had asked the guy at Belle Tire about the back tires, but he told me it was normal for car back tires to be slightly slanted. I wonder how much had detached when they rotated the tires. When we got home, we found rusted metal bits of my car on our driveway. I shudder to think what might have happened if we had not hit that pothole and turned around.				- Cr M.,				Ann Arbor, US"

When up on the hoist, the rear axle actually hung a few inches below the frame (see pics), only the front two mount (of the rear) were holding in place.

In discussion with the diagnosing mechanic, nothing this catastrophic had ever been seen before. However, there is a fair amount of blog conversation about severe under body rust on Honda vehicles. Some it seems to be due to improper A/C drain line placement.If we hadn't experienced the noise warning, followed by a visual inspection that seemed to show the rear wheels tilted very slightly inward, we may not have taken the vehicle in promptly for full diagnosis of the problem. Our rear axle probably could have completely broken away while in transit!! That would have had disastrous results, probably significant injury, or even . . . . .Of course, the Honda dealership advises there are ""no technical bulletins"" or recalls for this tragedy. A perfectly well running car is now nothing but scrap. We have long been pleased with the Honda performance, but this scenario taints our decision as to whether trust the product line again.				- Dean R.,				Peoria, IL, US"

This, I imagine, can happen with any door. Luckily, the jam is in the unlocked position allowing the door to be opened. What is not safe is that door cannot be locked leaving the car vulnerable to theft or car jacking. If the door was jammed in the locked position, this can be unsafe for passenger exit in the event of emergency (a fire or emersion in water). Any electric door lock mechanism made by any vehicle manufacturer should be designed to fail safe allowing manual locking and unlocking of the door in the event of electrical power lock mechanism failure. This is just as much a safety issue as a jammed seat belt or faulty airbag. This should be a no cost repair by manufacturer dealerships like they do with jammed seat belts or faulty airbags. At least they should be able to free up the lock mechanism without charge to customers. This needs to be seriously reviewed and addressed by NHTSA for safety with policy and repair procedures and practices clearly spelled out. This failure happened as a result of remote key activation of the door locks with no manual physical operation of the door itself.							- Wichita, KS, USA"

I was told to take it to the Honda dealer and if it is a problem with the transmission it will be replaced at no charge. I took it to the dealer and told them what Honda told me and they said it is probably the torque converter. (code P0740) the supervisor was going to call Honda and get back to me. I feel very frightened to travel on the highway when my check engine light is still on and having trouble with the transmission. I just can't believe that a 2003 Honda Pilot with only 130,000 miles would have issues with the transmission and/or torque converter !! if it is causing gears to chip or break I don't want to be driving on the highway and possibly be injured or even killed ! or causing injury to others.							- Appleton, WI, USA"

We have approximately 5,000 total miles on the vehicle which we special ordered and received in January 2003 (today is November 14, 2003). We do not drive it much except for family trips. I have a potential theory to bounce off you good folks... being an engineer, I was a bit concerned about the power steering pump not being flooded by the fluid reservoir. I was even more concerned that the reservoir was below the pump. I was assured by the salesman that there were no issues with the arrangement. I later learned about the reported pulley failures. Again I was assured that was fixed by a new design. Well, now we have two pump failures with only 5000 miles on the vehicle. By failure I mean that the pump started making excessively loud whining noises consistent with dry gear mesh noise. We brought it into the dealer prior to driving to the point of actual failure. Here is the theory... I suspect that the power steering pump cannot hold enough vacuum in the fluid supply line to maintain lubrication of the pump. Once the engine has set for a longer period of time, the pump could lose it's prime and begin to run dry on the next usage of the vehicle. If not running completely dry, maybe there is enough loss of prime to cause cavitation in the pump. Could it be that if this is not caught soon enough that the heat generated causes thermal expansion of the gear sets resulting in the pump seizing up"" if the pump seizes up, would it then be possible to present enough force by the serpentine belt to create enough torque to sheer off the pulley"" let me know what you think. I am certainly going to have a discussion with my dealership on this (again).							- Greenville, WI, USA"

I called Honda directly to see if they wanted the parts to inspect ( I have it in my possession) and investigate but they want me to pay for shipping it back to them or deliver it to a local dealer. The main reason I called their headquarters in the first place was to make them aware of a possible safety issue. I do not feel I should make the effort or expense to send it back to them for them to see if there is a defect, which in my opinion there is. My truck had 48353 miles at the time.

I sprayed some WD-40 in the ignition and it is coming out on the key like old dirty oil. Something must be made of substandard metal and is wearing off with the friction.

Eventually, it went in and I am still able to start/stop the engine but the key would not come out. At that time, (2009), they quoted about $800 ($700 USD) to fix it. It has been in the ignition for the last 6 years and about 100,000 km, (60,000 mi). I took the vehicle in on (June 23, 2015), to have the ignition ""interlock lever"" recall, (campaign code of L65, from bulletin # J-5-13 on Feb 7, 2013), work done, hoping that the recall was all about or directly related to this this key stuck problem. They called me in the afternoon to say that they could NOT do the ""interlock Lever"" repair work because the key is stuck in the ignition and they are unable to remove the key. They quoted a new price of $471, (about $400 US), to replace the entire ignition which is $212.27 plus labor $199 plus re-key old keys to the new ignition $60. I tried to reason with them by suggesting that the reason the key won't come out is because of the interlock lever being excessively worn as it states in the service bulletin. They disagreed as it says in the bulletin that the warranty repair is only for ""wear of the interlock lever"" and does NOT cover other ""failures in the interlock system"". Furthermore, they state that my problem is with the ignition key tumblers and not the interlock system.I like the suggestion to pull it apart myself and take the ignition assembly to a locksmith. I managed to get the Honda reception person to print out the full 16 page service bulletin which has pictures and detailed instruction on the replacement of the interlock lever (kit P/N: 06351-S84-000), and/or lock cylinder (kit P/N: 06352-S9V-A01) which of course shows the dis-assembly of the steering column.

655,Honda,Pilot,2004,transmission problems,"""D"" Light Flashes Occasionally",Pilot,Automatic transmission,"127,000 miles","This is my first experience with a Honda -- heard nothing but compliments about the reliability, low repair cost, excellent service, and high resale value of these vehicles. I purchased my vehicle used (I'm the second owner), taking care to find a vehicle with a clean Carfax and no major issues.So about two weeks after I purchased the vehicle, the ""D"" light starts blinking on the console. Uh-oh. Research the issue online and find this is a common problem -- it either means a transmission problem, or it means the sensor is faulty. My transmission fluid looked a little low so I purchased two quarts from Holmes (always use Honda fluid) and topped it off. So far, no performance issues at all -- just the blinking ""D"" intermittently (usually when it was hot outside).About a week later, the blinking ""D"" returned, so -- dropped it off at Holmes Honda to pull the code. As mentioned elsewhere in these forums, the service at Holmes is impeccable. They performed a multi-point inspection on the vehicle for free and replaced the faulty sensor ($169.49 parts and labor) and did a rear brake job (replaced pads, resurfaced rotors, $254.12 parts and labor). The blinking ""D"" did indeed go away.But...two weeks later, I'm on a two-hour commute (my job typically has me travelling between 30-240 miles per day). and the CHECK ENGINE light comes on. You Honda owners know this is a scary yellow icon of an engine that means you better get it to the shop. I took mine to Holmes the next day (10/1/10). Now I had performance issues, too -- when I needed to accelerate suddenly (to make a left turn, for instance) the Pilot would hesitate 1-2 seconds before responding.This was a Friday after lunch. Didn't hear from my service writer until Tuesday morning, with BAD news. Computer pulled a PO740 code -- TC clutch failure. This is the torque converter (solenoid) that serves as a controller for the transmission. If the torque converter starts coming apart, little pieces of the material can flow to other parts of the transmission (i.e. your gears and clutches) and cause complete failure.The DPSM (all-powerful District Parts and Service Manager) authorized my dealer to perform the repair at a 25 percent ""participation"" (discount). This means a $3,061 bill (!!) on a repair written up at a total cost of $4193 (!!!). I thanked my service writer and let him know that this amount was unacceptable. Remember, I'm a first-time Honda owner who's already spent $460 at the dealer on minor issues and I've only owned the car for two months.I'd already done some research on this issue (thanks to this forum and many others) and seen that this code (PO740) and accompanying issues (2nd gear clutch failure, 4th gear pressure switch failure, TC clutch failure) are all related to an acknowledged fault in 2003-2004 Honda transmissions. The specific recall (P30, issued April 2004) recommended replacing or modifying the transmission for 1.1 million affected vehicles. But your VIN has to be on a list (mine wasn't).In addition, the lack of screens/filters inside these Honda transmissions (as used by other manufacturers) allow the failure of a minor part (TC clutch) to progressively destroy major parts (the gears and clutches). Another ACKNOWLEDGED design flaw.I want to stress again how professional and helpful the reps at my local dealer (Holmes Honda in Shreveport, LA) are. However, my dealings with American Honda customer service are another story. A representative of my dealer had told me that if you didn't purchase from the dealer ""Honda doesn't consider you a customer."" I thought this was an outrageous thing to say -- until I actually called the number and found out for myself!I opened a case with American Honda on 10/5/10 and let them know my situation (new Honda customer, used vehicle owned two months and already $3521 in repair bills). Honda's representative, Reggie, entered my information into a case file and informed me that Honda corporate ""usually"" will not override a DPSM's decision (translation: there must be SOMETHING I can do or say to get them to contact the DPSM on my behalf.)He said other outrageous things as well -- suggesting that my best outlets in this situation would be contacting the BBB (!) or contacting a lawyer (!!) and initially insisting that there was ""no one to escalate this to."" Call center Reggie must be as high as you can go at American Honda!When I insisted that Reggie escalate the call, he refused at first (""I basically have the same authority as a supervisor"") and then eventually offered to transfer my call to an unnamed female supervisor. However, he cautioned me that ""assistance will not be provided"" (I wrote all of these gems down) and I would just be blowing off steam. The female supervisor was busy, but I was promised a callback within 24 hours.24 hours passed with no call. Called Honda customer service promptly, got representative ""Michael"" who was slightly more knowledgeable than Reggie, but basically spent the entire call arguing with me and reiterating the sentiment that Honda corporate will not override a DPSM. He used an interesting word in the conversation regarding the ""process"" of determining when Honda will give a customer the 50 percent participation rate (as Claude received, with the same DPSM, dealer, mileage, model year, etc.), who gets 25 percent, and who gets nothing.Michael advised me to call my dealer (again) and ask them to contact the same DPSM (no review process or second pair of eyes, just grovelling). Notice how it is the customer (me) who has to explain the issue over and over again without Honda taking ANY responsibility, contacting me when they promised (at a cost of $30/day to me for a rental vehicle), acknowledging the P30 recall or any other transmission faults, etc.So I spoke to several folks at Holmes and pleaded my case once more. I was told something very interesting in the course of these conversations: Honda used to offer a lot more ""goodwill"" assistance but due to the recession there has been a lot of ""belt-tightening"" and they have seen fewer and fewer approved repairs. One representative at my dealer expressed surprise that the DPSM authorized ANY participation at all. But they promised to call and grovel on my behalf.So I finally called back yesterday (10/8/10), again no follow-up from my dealer or Honda corporate -- I had to call. The District J DPSM (Eric, no last name or contact number provided) not only denied my request for any additional participation from Honda, but placed a 30 DAY EXPIRATION on his original offer. Take it or leave it!So I do some more research and find that most transmission shops will rebuild a Honda transmission for around $2200-2400. In addition, there are third-party vendors that rebuild Honda transmissions and resell them for about the same price ($2400), but with a superior warranty to what Honda is offering.Honda's remanufactured transmission is a $2957 behemoth, with an additional $109 freight charge to ship which they pass on to the customer. The transmission case (core) of your existing transmission becomes Honda property with no credit given, even though it's a $1500 part. Then, they only guarantee the replacement for 3 years OR 36,000 MILES (!!!). Also, $928 labor because they have to drop the axles, frame, etc. to get to it.These third-party transmissions cost $2400 but have a 5 YEAR/100,000 MILE warranty. Now that's more like it -- but you're still stuck with the labor cost, cost of filling the new tranny with Honda fluid, etc. Probably a $3000 bill anyway.My point in posting this here is that the very things that attracted me to this car (reliability, low repair cost, excellent service) all turned out to be FALSE. Unreliable (major failure at 128K miles), at least a $3000 repair bill however you slice it, and absolutely NO service or sympathy from Honda corporate. The ""process"" that call center Michael described boils down to this: Has this car been repaired multiple times at Honda dealers? (Answer: no, my car has a clean Carfax never had transmission service) And are you the original owner? (Answer: no, I'm a second owner and purchased through a non-Honda dealer). So, because my car has NOT had significant problems, and because I did NOT pay the markup initially by purchasing from a Honda dealer...This is the chief reason I believe other owners have been offered the 50 percent off deal, but I only got offered a 25 percent off deal that expires in 30 days. My inclination at present is to let Holmes do the repair work using a third-party rebuild with the better warranty. It will likely be a $3200 bill. Due to all of the delays with the DPSM and Honda corporate never calling me back, I've now racked up a $220 (and climbing) car rental bill. And let's not forget the original $170 I paid Holmes to replace the 4th gear pressure switch which was just doing its job.Shame on Honda customer service for (a) providing no review process for local DPSM decisions; (b) not calling back when they said they would, costing me an additional $60 in car rental delays; (c) not providing any contact info for the DPSM and referring me back to my dealer to re-explain my issue (another $60 in delays); (d) not acknowledging the history of this KNOWN defect in Honda transmissions (including the P30 recall) and disparaging the source of the information (""this is something you read on the INTERNET, right?"").Um, right!				- Will B.,				Minden, LA, US"

I found that the last few days it has shuddered violently on startup and almost stalled and from doing my internet research (hours of it in the last 2 years) I have found that countless numbers of people suffered the EXACT SAME PROBLEM and Honda has so far refused to acknowledge any problem at all. I am now stuck with waiting for it to fail completely as I cannot afford at this point in time to just go have a new transmission put in and that is the only fix. I did have the tranny fluid changed and some anti-shudder added as I read was suggested on several other posts, and that did help an awful lot with the shudder on shifting from 2-3, but now the problem has progressed.

When I asked the dealership if this part would be covered and the repair part of the recall I was told it was three parts and would not be covered. I came to find out the only way the ignition switch could be repaired if deformed was through this one part at the same dealership that sold my mechanic the 3 piece connected part as one.. 1/Ignition Switch, 2/Steering lock housing 3/Ignition key and cylinder. What a scam, and to top it off because the recall is required at the dealership the only way I can be $469.00 reimbursed is through a written complaint to the corporation, review , and told it would take up to 10-12 weeks for any response and no gaurantee of the reimbursement. This is not right, not to mention that the part was sold to the mechanic and only sells together all three in one.

I stayed in the waiting room until it was done. When the lot guy brought the vehicle around, the service tech said the passenger side rear side window was down and the regulator had likely broken. I rarely, if ever use the rear window. He said when they removed the lock box, the window fell and would not return. He said this is a common problem with Pilots but, unless I had an extended warranty with such coverage, it would cost me in excess of $250 to repair. He said, the ""good news"" is they had the part in stock if I had another two hours to wait!!! I contend that if they had not lowered my window to put on a lock box, which was not needed since I was in the Tempe Honda dealer waiting room, my window would still be up here in this 112++ degree weather. Perhaps it would have broken sometime later, but this was on the dealer's lot and caused by their unauthorized use of my window control. Upon returning home, I removed the door panel, raised the window manually and taped it on all sides so it will not fall.

I am curious, since a quick internet search revealed 5 different sites with consumers complaining about this same issue in 2005 Pilots, why the Honda dealership mechanics didn't know what to look for when I repeatedly lodged the same complaint. And since a factory trained Honda master technician with 24 years experience working on Hondas (according to onlline site justanswer.com) states that a transmission should last in excess of 200,000 miles, I am curious as to why Honda does not take responsibility and cover the cost to replace these faulty converters and transmissions.

The car had been driven about 4 miles and was parked at the time of the incident. There was no visible damage to the transmission line or the radiator but both had to be replaced according to the Honda dealer.the cost of replacement was $641.55 and none of this was covered by Honda. We believe that this is a serious defect in the Honda Pilot and is a major problem in both the Honda Pilot and Odyssey van. This connection was not damaged and simply let loose. It has occurred in many other vehicles at different amounts of mileage from my vehicle. This connection should never come loose under normal driving conditions and is a serious defect with significant safety concerns. The repair person at the dealer told me that they are seeing a lot of these problems and that the line simply blows out under the pressure from inside the radiator (he said about 110 psi) Honda should be held responsible for this defect and all Honda Pilot and Odyssey vans should be recalled and the defect corrected before serious injuries occur. We believe you should investigate this further and have Honda take corrective action. As I investigated this I determined that in some cases the coolant and radiator fluid mix together and cause serious damage to the transmission. This is caused by the same problem but the repair cost go into the thousands $ because of the damage to the transmission. 							- Southampton, PA, USA"

This happened on a nearly empty tank of gas at about 3:15 pm on Saturday 4/16/16. It was a hot day. The parking space was at a slight incline. I was moving very slowly nearly stopped, yet once I was about a third of the way into the space, while still gently breaking, my car suddenly lurched forward with tremendous force if I had completely floored the gas pedal. I reacted fast pushed the breaks hard with all my strength. Which engaged the antilock braking so I heard a ""thud-thud thud"" a loud repeated clunking-locking sound. My Pilot did stop before hitting a tree and the vehicle in the facing parking space. I did not hear the engine rev to the degree of the sudden forward motion. Nor did I hear revving resolve once it stopped. It was a very odd and frightening experience that baffled my mind. I tried to sort out the cause for a while to see if maybe I had without knowing it put my foot on both pedals. But I don't think so. I had sandals on, and in trying to reproduce the situation, or the position my foot would have to have been in to do that, was awkward and I would have felt the pressure on my foot of putting on the gas. And I was only slowly pressing the break not jamming on the break ' until I braked to stop the speed of it lurching forward. The degree of acceleration was as if the gas pedal was put to the floor which was not what my breaking foot was doing. The car did come to a stop just in time to not hit what was at the front of the parking space. I did not hear the engine noise rev at all.

My vehicle started losing power upon acceleration so the engine revved but car slowed down. I made it off the ramp to the highway and was able to pull off to the shoulder. The car has an automatic transmission so I thought maybe it wasn't clicking into place properly but it was. I noticed a puddle of fluid. I had it towed to a mechanic who said that the transmission cooling line blew out & the radiator will have to be replaced along with the adapter because there are no threads left on the radiator to grab the connector. He said it was something that's not supposed to happen. It was a mechanical failure. I have read several posts on line on a number of web sites from owners with this same problem. Most people have also replaced their transmissions because the radiator and transmission fluids ruin both when mixed together. My car is still at the mechanics, so I don't know about the transmission yet, but the posts indicate that the car is never the same. I was lucky that I had enough juice to pull over to safety. Apparently there are no recalls from Honda in spite of the numerous complaints that I've seen. Repairs are expensive & this problem seems to occur mostly within the 100,000 mile range, give or take. If I get rid of the car before or after fixing it, it would only be a problem for the next consumer & that's not really fair. I feel that Honda should reimburse current owners for transmissions and radiator replacements on those cars that have had the problem and recall/repair the parts on the ones that haven't. I feel that this is an important issue because my car could have come to a complete stop on the highway and caused a serious & potentially fatal accident. Honda needs to take responsibility for this defect before someone gets hurt or killed. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.							- Downingtown, PA, USA"

Have always noticed a slight radiator fluid smell. No one could find any leak. About 3 years later at 110,000 miles, transmission fluid and radiator fluid mixed when the radiator gave out. We were out of town and on our way home leaving us on the side of the road to be towed back into town (approx 30 miles) and had to spend an extra night until the repairs were finished. $637 repair for the radiator. 2 months later noticed the air conditioner not working. Took it to our local guy who said it wasn't hooked up right when they replaced the radiator. Correct hookup, pressure test and recharge air system was $186. A week later after explaining the radiator problem to my local repair guy we had the transmission flushed twice to try to save us from future transmission trouble. $292 for the transmission flush related to the radiator failure. Now a month and a half later we have a shudder between 35 and 45 mph and a noise at about 55 mph that sound like a piece of metal dropping off the car. Asked the local repair shop and transmission repair shop and they both said the transmission was damaged and needed to be replaced. Went with the transmission place, after reading all the similar stories of other 2005 Honda Pilot, the dealers will over charge and not even admit to this known issue.

The radiators are failing at the transmission fittings attached to the bottom of the radiators. There are several thousand complaints about this issue and Honda is denying there is a problem. The problem is the transmission cooler is built into the bottom of the radiator. The cooler sits in the bottom of the radiator. There are two transmission fittings on the out side of the radiator that attach to the transmission. This brings transmission fluid in the radiator cooler, cools the fluid and returns it to the transmission. Now inside the bottom radiator sits the transmission cooler which is just a small pipe witch is attached to the transmission fittings. When the fluid enters the radiator cooler it gets instantly cooled and returned to transmission because the cooler is submerged in radiator fluid. This is because the bottom of the radiator is the coolest at the bottom. What's happening is the transmission fittings are rusting away and failing allowing radiator fluid to enter the return line to the transmission. When radiator fluid enters the transmission the transmission is done. You need a replacement. These problem is happening to several Honda and Nissan. The two car company's use the same manufacturing for the radiator. The company is dense. The failing on Honda and Nissan.

Last Saturday, out of nowhere, it started to leak thick, pink liquid on our driveway. It appeared to me, and after looking at the owner's manual, that the issue was the radiator. It was a cold day so I started to drive to the dealer, watching the engine temperature light on the way. The car only went two miles before transmission stopped working. The car has now been at a local repair shop for a week and three days while I rent another vehicle. It is my understanding that this is a common issue in Pilot's after going over 100,000 miles (catastrophic radiator failure that leads to transmission failure). Honda should make certain that owners replace the radiator components that lead to this catastrophic failure before the owner has to replace both the radiator and the transmission. I would have certainly bought a new car if I had known this was coming up on the horizon, but now my investment in this vehicle will be too high to get rid of it.

I contacted my dealer and was told it would cost $2185 to repair. It took the dealership longer than expected to obtain the necessary repair parts. The actual cost a was bit more $2233 plus tax. After viewing so many other complaints regarding the driver's seat I feel that Honda should be proactively checking and making the necessary repairs. If the seat should become completely detached from the base the driver will lose control of the vehicle. Possibly causing a very serious accident. The cost to repair seems outrageously high for just a couple of small pieces of metal.							- Chillicothe, IL, USA"

A couple days later I'm tooling along at freeway speed and for a brief second it felt like someone slammed on the brakes and released, and the VSA light came on. Took it to the dealership and the codes they found were for some sort of a power drop and blamed it on a possible power outage or drop at some point. Maybe alternator, battery or something, but they didn't find anything wrong with any of those, but it cost me $125 to be told they don't know. The VSA recall was completed in 2012 for the wiring harness. Today (a week later) I'm going about 25 on a surface street and the exact same thing happened, so I took it to the dealership without turning off the engine and possibly clearing any codes. What they came back with was a faulty Yaw Sensor code, but they want to keep it for a couple days to do further research. I'm told it is connected to the main computer and if it is the Yaw Sensor then the main computer has to be replaced, at a cost of $1650 (they will credit toward the repair the $125 I paid last week for the non-answer).

I have owned 5 HONDA's and currently have three of them. They said if you do not buy new they do not even have you on record and if you do not routinely take your car to Honda for service we do not consider you a loyal Honda owner. I finally got to a supervisor as she would not give me her supervisor's name which is Bryan. I spoke to Kathryn and she basically reinstated the same. She said she had owned a used Honda and does not take to any dealer because their prices are too high. Go figure. They showed no compassion for such a vehicle malfunction and I guess I will talk about this from now on instead of how I love my Honda's. There is always Toyota. Very disappointed in the outcome. A little compassion does not cost the company any $$$$. If you search this problem you will find it is a reoccurring with the 2005 Pilot and two deaths have been linked to it.

As of the last couple of weeks, again I experienced same exact vehicle safety issues prior to repair. This past week while I had my three children in the car, we almost lost our lives. A semi driver instead risked his own lives to keep from slamming in the back of us. We took our Pilot to Honda dealership that has serviced our vehicle over the years and they do not want to recognize issue and instead point to the same thing I am now reading here online. The dealership service department states it is the yaw sensor as the issue, not faulty repair. It is not a coincidence that Pilot owners are now once again are experiencing the same issues all over again. How many lives will be lost or changed for the worst before Honda is forced to reckon with this issue? this is wrong and unacceptable. There are other poor design flaws that we think also may have cost us so much more money, such as the vvt issues. However, the vsa repair issue is not something that can be overlooked and must be dealt with now. Specifically, my experience mostly on flat surfaces with exception of one time on a slight incline at a stop light. Both in town driving and intersate and all dry weather conditions except one occasion. The vsa light flashed, vehicle applied brake at without my foot on brake pedal. My foot was on accelerator at the time vehicle was being harshly stopped by the brakes applied. This caused the vehicle to make a bucking motion or jerking motion, also I've experienced the slight swerve. I was driving in a straight direction all of the times this occurred since the repair in 2013. It depended on the amount of pressure and length of time the vehicle acted up. Everything is just as it did prior to the repair in 2013, nothing is any different, all the same. Yet, Honda wants to say I need to cover repair.							- Bedford, KY, USA"
906,Honda,Pilot,2005,brakes problems,NHTSA: Service Brakes,Pilot,"51,000 miles",,"			The yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor is faulty and should be included in Honda's 2013 recall of the vsa. The vehicle has the exact symptoms of the vsa recall, which was fixed on my vehicle. I purchased the car last year with very low miles, only drove for a few months before it started having issues. Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone.

925,Honda,Pilot,2005,brakes problems,NHTSA: Electronic Stability Control,Pilot,"51,000 miles",,"			The yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor is faulty and should be included in Honda's 2013 recall of the vsa. The vehicle has the exact symptoms of the vsa recall, which was fixed on my vehicle. I purchased the car last year with very low miles, only drove for a few months before it started having issues. Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone. It is absolutely dangerous and even the dealer recommends it be fixed immediately, yet Honda has declared no fault.							- Fillmore, IN, USA"

There is a vsa off button that I engage before driving which was suggested to me to do but even with the vsa turned off, the vsa will (however less frequently), still engage at random.

Suddenly the vehicle made a loud grinding noise that seemed to come from the front of it. It went away and I continued driving slowly (about 15 - 20 mph) to see if I could detect something further wrong or if I had run over something. As I found no indication of the cause of the noise I continued on. Within approximately one city block the vehicle seemed to apply the brakes and slowed itself to a crawl. I did not apply the brakes! the noise again occurred while this happened. The noise, I realized, was similar to anti-lock brakes activating during a hard stop. This occurred three more times in rapid succession and then went away. I continued on trying to figure out what was wrong and applied the brakes myself. They seemed to work ok. As I proceeded, the brakes once again applied themselves (with absolutely no action from me) another four times. At this time the vsa light came on the dash. I attempted to turn it off, but was not sure if it did turn off or not. I drove another two to three miles without further problems.

They came back after five or ten minutes to tell me while they were changing the oil, (which was one of the list of things they wanted to do for me, ""While they had the car"", at my cost), the oil pan lug broke and it would cost me an extra $120.00 to fix. I naturally had a problem with this as it was their mechanic who took it off. I told them I would go half with them since it was an old car and probably an old lug, (I didn't know). Would up spending the next two hours arguing with different levels of management, to no avail. When the car was ready I paid them (reluctantly), and asked them if the recall was done and if they had checked the seat belt light. They told me everything was taken care of. When I left their garage I was a bit P. O.'d that the AIR BAG light was STILL ON. They actually let me leave their garage with a potentially life threatening safety issue. I have teenage sons that use the car and I have grandchildren who always ride with us. Needless to say......

A major reason I chose the 2005 Honda Pilot EXL-DVD was the side curtain airbags. However, when I was struck broadside by another vehicle with enough force that the Pilot was declared a total loss the side airbag failed to deploy. This failure to deploy thereby causing my head to impact on the driver's side door frame hard enough to cause a large lump on the side of my head and resulting in concussion and other injuries. Some of the injuries are permanent and I am still in severe pain and being treated by multiple doctors eighteen months after the collision with no improvement nor any current outlook for recovery! I now have a permanent hearing loss as well as tinnitus preventing me from having even a few minutes of peace & quiet! While the accident was the fault of the driver that ran a stop sign and ""T-boned"" my car, had the air bag deployed I strongly feel it would have prevented my head from the severe impact with the metal frame of the Honda Pilot and I would not have spent the last eighteen months in pain severe enough to prevent me from having a normal life!

The issue is that the front passenger side seatbelt has been worn thin (to the point where it will almost certainly fail in a crash) by what appears to be a poorly made bucikle. Where the seat belt strap runs through the buckle there appears to be a rough edge that has slowly worn through the fabric of the belt itself. The two Honda garages we contacted refused to repair the vehicle under warranty, so we have paid a local garage to fit a new belt. There has been no incident with respect to this, but we are reporting this in case others have had the same issue.							- Seattle, WA, USA"

In the first case, in February 2009, the sensor light came on while we were driving back to Pennsylvania from North Carolina. Examination at the Honda dealer in pa determined that one of the two front sensors had failed due to corrosion and an electrical short. The unit was replaced. Six months later the sensor light came on again and it was determined that the other sensor failed. The cause of the failure was corrosion and an electrical short. In both cases, the airbag would not have operated had their been an accident. The dealer claimed the failures were, ""just one of those things"". having worked with passive restraint systems in the past and having worked with nearly all automobile companies (including Toyota and Honda in Japan), I doubted this explanation. These were improperly manufactured and sealed sensors and corrosion/failure was inevitable. This is a rare failure if the components are manufactured properly.							- West Chester, PA, USA"

The belt starts in the cealing so far forward that when a person without a thick upper body sits in the center position in the 2nd row, the belt passes next to the cheek rather than the shoulder. In the case of a child who is too big to be in a booster with a back but is still relatively small, the shoulder belt actually passes in front of the shoulder and descends to the buckle without even touching the shoulder or the upper chest! this leaves the child in a position to have her neck perhaps broken or otherwise be injured by the belt in the event of a side collision from the left. Moreover, it also leaves parents with three children, such as me, who need to use the full cargo area for cargo, faced with the unacceptable choice between placing the shoulder harness behind the child's back or placing the the child in the 3rd row and eliminating much of the needed cargo space. The Honda service dealer advised that is just the way the vehicle is designed. Honda customer relations was even less helpfull. The representative simply said it ""complies with all government standards"" and then refused to refer me to a supervisor or anyone else at Honda headquarters in California or tell me the phone number for Honda headquarters in California. Surely it does not comply with federal rules to design a belt so that it does not even make contact with the shoulder and upper chest of a child once they are too large for a booster with a back and are therefore sitting against the uptight part of the 2nd row seat rather than being moved forward by the booster. Honda needs to place the belt about six inches further back on the ceiling or attach an adapter to the back of the second row that would come over the seat and grasp the shoulder harness when a child or small woman is seated in the second position. Please help before some child is injured. 							- Parkland, FL, USA"

After making a couple calls and getting people there to help, we found that all the Antifreeze and ATF had spilled out of the car. There weren't any big spills on the road, so I think things had been leaking for awhile. I had not noticed anything wrong until the incident. When I called Honda to verify my warranty, they were very pleased to tell me that my warranty period had expired 45 days before the incident. They were in no way going to help with any information or service. I had the car towed to a local mechanic (former Honda employee). He had the car for two days and had it fixed for me.He showed me what happened to the car. The threads that hold the transmission cooling line into the radiator had given out. When the line broke loose it took the threads from the radiator side. So, the radiator had to be replaced as well the cooling lines. He had to replace the coolant as well as the ATF. The cost was around $550.00.It seems very strange to me that the lines would separate like they did. I am the original owner of the car and put all 95,000 miles on it. The car has never had an accident nor has it had any damage to the undercarriage. I hope this might help someone else. I would also hope that this somehow makes its way to the powers that be at Honda. I sure have enjoyed this car and will buy another Honda at some point.

In Aug 2007 I changed jobs and work near a large hospital construction area. In Nov, 2007 my ac unit began making a horrible noise, then a horrific smell ensued. Investigation by Honda revealed mice infestation in the ac unit. The repair was $8K and took one mo. Needless to say, we felt it was an isolated horrific disturbing once in a lifetime disaster! my car was returned to me in Jan 08. Over the past wk my ac unit began making a rumble, I ret'nd to Honda assumed there was a loose fitting. To my surprise, another mice infestation in the ac unit! my ins. Has been again notified. I have done some research online. I have located a site wombat nation, interesting that 90% of the vehicle complaints with rodent infestation are Honda?S! I contacted your cust service line, spoke with jamal who confirms Honda has no knowledge of such a problem. Do you really expect this consumer to believe that none of these other Honda consumers have contacted Honda? they deny the knock sensor problem. They deny the service bulletin 06012004-NHTSA 10014213? shame on Honda??forget the fact that my investment in a Honda is lost, have they considered the medical complications of hanta virus? do they not realize the seriousness of this condition and the fact that the Honda is harboring rodents"" being the vehicle is #1 in safety features, it most certainly would appear to be the safest with children! just imagine, mice in your car with your baby!this matter must be investigated further. I am contacting every consumer advocacy service possible to get the word out. Just imagine the potential danger of hwy driving and seeing a mouse in your car! please adv your comments.

A FEW DAYS LATER I COMPLAINED ABOUT IT HAVING A VIBRATION, TREMBLING AT 20 TO 30 MPH. ONCE YOU ACCELERATE GOING PAST THE 30MPH IT WOULD NOT DO IT. IT WOULD DO IT USUALLY WHEN THE CAR IS ALREADY WARMED UP. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE DEALERSHIP ON 2-8-2014 WHERE THE CAR WAS LOOKED AT AND THEY FOUND NOTHING. I HAD ORIGINALLY COMPLAINED AS THE SALES PERSON WHO SOLD ME THE VEHICLE SAID THE CAR HAD THE MAINTENANCE DONE, LIKE TIMING BELT, ACCORDING TO THE MILES THE CAR HAD. WELL, COME TO FIND THEY HAD NO RECORD OF IT BEING DONE, SO OUT OF COURTESY FROM THE GENERAL MANAGER MIKE, HE ORDERED TO HAVE THE TIMING BELT DONE, WATER PUMP OUT OF COURTESY, BUT NO RESOLUTION ON THE VIBRATION IT HAD. I WAS JUST TOLD TO JUST BRING IT BACK IF IT CONTINUED TO HAVE THE SAME ISSUEWELL IT HAS ALWAYS HAD THAT PROBLEM SINCE I BECAME THE NEW OWNER AND SINCE IT'S SOMETHING THEIR COMPUTER DOESN'T PICK UP OR NO INDICATOR LIGHT COMES ON, THEN BASICALLY THERE'S NOTHING THEY CAN DO. NOW HERE IT IS A YEAR LATER AND VTM LIGHT AND ENGINE LIGHT COMES ON. I AGAIN CONTACTED THEM AND ALSO MENTIONED ONCE AGAIN THAT IT CONTINUED TO HAVE THE VIBRATION TREMBLING BUT MORE EVIDENT, BUT AGAIN AT 20-30MPH.I BROUGHT IT IN TO HONDA ON 2-24-15. SAID THE VEHICLE NEEDED TO HAVE THE VALVE ADJUSTED, SPARK PLUGS AND TUNE UP DONE AND WAS TOLD BY THE SERVICE ADVISER JERRY, THAT BY DOING THIS WORK TO IT MAY TAKE AWAY THE SYMPTOM OF THE TREMBLING. I TOLD HIM IT'S NOT FAIR TO ME THAT I WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE WHOLE BILL $944 AS IT WAS AN ISSUE FROM THE BEGINNING. ONCE AGAIN I MADE PHONE CONTACT WITH THE GENERAL MANAGER MIKE, HE DIDN'T ANSWER BUT I LEFT A MESSAGE WITH THE ISSUE. HE THEN TELLS HIS SERVICE ADVISER THAT BEST THEY CAN DO IS SPLIT THE BILL. I AGREED, I PAID $423. I BROUGHT BACK THE HONDA PILOT TO HAVE THIS WORK DONE TO IT ON 3-03-15, HERE IT IS 3-19-15 AND THIS VEHICLE STARTS TO DO THE SAME TREMBLING ACTION ON 20-30MPH. I'M JUST UNHAPPY WITH THIS AS THEY CAN'T SEEM TO FIGURE OUT THE PROBLEM. I DON'T THINK THEIR TAKING THEIR TIME TO FIGURE IT OUT. I ONCE AGAIN CALLED ON THE GENERAL MANAGER TODAY 3-19-15, LEFT A MESSAGE COMPLAINING ABOUT THE ISSUE SO LET'S SEE WHAT THEY PLAN TO DO.I JUST WANT TO BE SAFE IN THIS VEHICLE AND THAT THEY TAKE INITIATIVE AND RESEARCH THE PROBLEM AND FIX IT ONCE AND FOR ALL. THIS WILL BE THE LAST HONDA I'M BUYING. I'VE READ A LOT OF COMPLAINING HERE TODAY AND I SEE THE VARIABLE CYLINDER CONTROL SYSTEM OR DRIVETRAIN MAY BE THE CULPRIT BUT NOT SURE, I'M NO MECHANIC BUT I WISH SOMEONE WOULD GIVE ME THE BEST SUGGESTION AS TO WHAT WOULD FIX THE PROBLEM OR WHAT I CAN DO AT THIS POINT. IF IT'S NOT FIXABLE, MIND YOU, I PURCHASED AN EXTENDED WARRANTY WHICH EXPIRES IN JAN 2016. I REALLY HOPE WE CAN GET THIS FIGURED OUT.				- Carmen C.,				Stockton, CA, US"

As of the last couple of weeks, again I experienced same exact vehicle safety issues prior to repair. This past week while I had my three children in the car, we almost lost our lives. A semi driver instead risked his own lives to keep from slamming in the back of us. We took our Pilot to Honda dealership that has serviced our vehicle over the years and they do not want to recognize issue and instead point to the same thing I am now reading here online. The dealership service department states it is the yaw sensor as the issue, not faulty repair. It is not a coincidence that Pilot owners are now once again are experiencing the same issues all over again. How many lives will be lost or changed for the worst before Honda is forced to reckon with this issue? this is wrong and unacceptable. There are other poor design flaws that we think also may have cost us so much more money, such as the vvt issues. However, the vsa repair issue is not something that can be overlooked and must be dealt with now. Specifically, my experience mostly on flat surfaces with exception of one time on a slight incline at a stop light. Both in town driving and intersate and all dry weather conditions except one occasion. The vsa light flashed, vehicle applied brake at without my foot on brake pedal. My foot was on accelerator at the time vehicle was being harshly stopped by the brakes applied. This caused the vehicle to make a bucking motion or jerking motion, also I've experienced the slight swerve. I was driving in a straight direction all of the times this occurred since the repair in 2013. It depended on the amount of pressure and length of time the vehicle acted up. Everything is just as it did prior to the repair in 2013, nothing is any different, all the same. Yet, Honda wants to say I need to cover repair.							- Bedford, KY, USA"

1129,Honda,Pilot,2005,electrical problems,NHTSA: Electrical System,Pilot,"51,000 miles",,"			The yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor is faulty and should be included in Honda's 2013 recall of the vsa. The vehicle has the exact symptoms of the vsa recall, which was fixed on my vehicle. I purchased the car last year with very low miles, only drove for a few months before it started having issues. Started out having the vsa triangle light on dash and losing power (limp mode) only after coming out of a turn after driving vehicle for awhile. Increased to the point where after roughly 30 minutes of the vehicle running the vsa issue would happen at least once during the drive. Severity of the vsa/limp mode got worse, no power for longer at a time and the horrible grinding noise directly underneath cabin. Took to Honda complaining of these issues, couldn't replicate it so nothing was wrong. One month ago, my vehicle started having the un-commanded braking problem. Driving at 55 mph, the slightest touch to the brakes causes the vehicle to hard brake, causing a swerve at least going that fast. It has done this un-commanded braking more than once, I have been afraid to drive it and at least got it 30 minutes to my Honda dealer, which I also purchased the vehicle from. It was diagnosed with the faulty yaw rate lateral acceleration sensor. I have argued with Honda for the last three weeks over the issue, ultimately to be told that it was not included in the final recall, even though the investigation names the yaw sensor as possibly being implicated in the malfunction. $994 for the sensor alone. It is absolutely dangerous and even the dealer recommends it be fixed immediately, yet Honda has declared no fault.							- Fillmore, IN, USA"

A warrantee extension notice for my 2009 Honda Accord was forwarded to me by the person across town who received my notice. Last year the same person forwarded to me a takata airbag recall notice he received for my 2005 Honda Pilot. I purchased my 2005 Honda Pilot direct from Honda and my Accord from a private owner. Both vehicles are in the Honda service data base with my correct name, address, and VIN. I have no connection to that address, and the resident there does not have my name or any Honda vehicles. I have spoken to Honda service and the Honda recall center about this. Yet, in March the same issue occurred with my 2009 Honda Accord. Additionally, I have not received a notice on my 2010 Honda Accord (purchased from a Honda dealer), which, according to the notice, is part of the class of vehicles subject to the same extended warrantee. Honda's national service center could not explain to me how the mistake occurred and could not assure me that their records would be corrected for purposes of safety notifications since Honda has had my information correct in their service center database. Second issue: My notice of an extended warrantee on 2008-2010 Accord is for a corrosion issue with an internal component in the SRS electronic control unit that could potentially result in SRS failure. The notice stated that if the dashboard SRS light alerts you to an issue, you need to bring the vehicle in for inspection asap. The SRS light in my 2005 Honda Pilot illuminates intermittently. Honda said it is not covered, but they would diagnose it for $120/hr + repairs. For purposes of vehicle safety, can your office determine if the older Honda Pilot have the same SRS ECU issue as the 2008-2010 Honda Accord, and thus should be subject to a recall?							- Farmingdale, NY, USA"

1141,Honda,Pilot,2005,electrical problems,NHTSA: Electrical System,Pilot,"162,680 miles",,"			My daughter was driving our family's 2005 Honda Pilot. She applied the brake lightly which resulted in excessive breaking in the left front wheel and then appearance of the vsa light. I brought the vehicle to the Honda dealer who first indicated there was no recall and then indicated there was a vsa wire harness recall (NHTSA 13V-092) but that it did apply the vsa light going on and therefore had nothing to do with the recall. A vsa light diagnostics which I independently paid for indicated a yaw rate failure code (25-01). This light vsa light has continued to intermittently go on and off with an intermittent contemporaneous relationship to braking. On 2/25/15 my daughter was driving the vehicle on the highway (no vsa light on), applied the brakes lightly and the car braked severly even once her foot was off the brake and pulled the car in the same front right direction as before forcing her to swerve along side a passing truck. The vsa light went on after the event occurred. Calling the Honda dealer today, the service manager indicated that Honda does not have a recall on this matter once the part for the 13V-092 recall was replaced. In reviewing safer car.gov NHTSA campaign id number DP12002 it describes well what has occurred twice and which has not been corrected by the recall service performed. I have also contacted Honda usa. I believe Honda has inadequately evaluated the relationship of similarly reported events regarding unexpected car brake assist with mild application of the brake since the vsa wire harness recall repair did not resolve the unexpected and inappropriate vsa/ESC/ba system logic response. It is not clear why Honda is not addressing my matter under this recall (NHTSA 13V-092) and the referenced NHTSA DP12002, and further investigating under a known safety recall. 							- Altavista, VA, USA"

This loss of electrical power has occurred with the original battery, as well as two other batteries over the life of the car. It appears to be electrically related.

I noticed that the rear of the car had been sagging a bit but I didn't think anything of it because of the miles it had and figured the springs were just a little worn out. My wife pulled it in the driveway one afternoon and I noticed the rear of the vehicle was lower than normal (no additional weight in truck area). I looked underneath to inspect what could be the problem and saw that the rear suspension cradle that's mounted to the unibody cross member had broken the rear two bolts completely out from the cross member. I took pictures for documentation. This vehicle has many miles on it but it is only 10 years old and I feel that this should not have happened. I have never towed with this vehicle and never had anything over 200 pounds in the trunk area. In my opinion this seems like a serious safety issue because this could have ended much worse. I believe this is caused by water sitting in the cross member and rusting it from the inside out. The outside of the cross member has few signs of rust. Even though I haven't been able to find any information on this happening in the past I feel it needs to be brought to some attention before it becomes a real problem.

My vehicle started losing power upon acceleration so the engine revved but car slowed down. I made it off the ramp to the highway and was able to pull off to the shoulder. The car has an automatic transmission so I thought maybe it wasn't clicking into place properly but it was. I noticed a puddle of fluid. I had it towed to a mechanic who said that the transmission cooling line blew out & the radiator will have to be replaced along with the adapter because there are no threads left on the radiator to grab the connector. He said it was something that's not supposed to happen. It was a mechanical failure. I have read several posts on line on a number of web sites from owners with this same problem. Most people have also replaced their transmissions because the radiator and transmission fluids ruin both when mixed together. My car is still at the mechanics, so I don't know about the transmission yet, but the posts indicate that the car is never the same. I was lucky that I had enough juice to pull over to safety. Apparently there are no recalls from Honda in spite of the numerous complaints that I've seen. Repairs are expensive & this problem seems to occur mostly within the 100,000 mile range, give or take. If I get rid of the car before or after fixing it, it would only be a problem for the next consumer & that's not really fair. I feel that Honda should reimburse current owners for transmissions and radiator replacements on those cars that have had the problem and recall/repair the parts on the ones that haven't. I feel that this is an important issue because my car could have come to a complete stop on the highway and caused a serious & potentially fatal accident. Honda needs to take responsibility for this defect before someone gets hurt or killed. Thank you in advance for your attention to this matter.							- Downingtown, PA, USA"

First $400 spent. A week later, light came on again, this time along with low oil light. I was travelling: a different shop said my new spark plugs were fouled, and that the PCV valve also needed changing. That $500 repair got me home, when the problem happened again. This time I was told that the head needed to be pulled and the cylinders re-bored. Two weeks and $1800 later and the vehicle is no longer misfiring, but it now makes a ticking noise that wasn't there before, and its burning oil like crazy (I have to add a quart every time I fill up, and it makes a blue exhaust cloud every time I start it). Diagnostics say that the piston rings are bad. Fixing those would cost about the same as a new engine due to labor charges. I expect a Honda engine to last longer than 150K miles.

I'm a mechanic and first thought my valves needed to be adjusted or that something came loose. I pulled into the garage and used my stethoscope to try and narrow the problem to a certain cylinder, I was unable to do so. I pulled both valve covers and measured each cylinders valve clearance and all were within specs. I decided to look online for other Pilots with similar problems and to my surprise I found many other complaints and postings of the same problem for 2003-2008 Honda Pilots as well as the Ridgeline and MDX models with the same drivetrain. After more diagnosis I found that the sound is caused by piston slap in the #4 cylinder which is due to a cracked engine block. Also, the connecting rod bearings are loose and failing. If I continue to drive this way I will surely breakdown soon. The only solutions are to dismantle and rebuild the engine or buy a used one that may fail the same way. Used engine cost to my shop is $2K and 10 hrs labor to remove and install, rebuild is much higher.I purchased a Honda specifically b/c they were known for reliability and low maintenance costs. I have worked on nearly all of the brands of vehicles sold in the U.S. and most more have reliability issues than Honda or so I thought. I expected more from Honda. Honda has just settled a class action lawsuit for the later model Pilots and other models with a very similar problem.

As everyone describes after one mile of driving the vsa will come on if you attempt to accelerate when on it will engage the brakes but not fully so it shutters and RPM soar but you go no where causing daily near miss accidents. Honda dealers acknowledge this module is the issue but due to the 2006 not being on the govt recall list they will not repair or replace you have to pay to have it done at a cost of $1650. The Honda mechanic showed me the whitepaper Honda has on how to replace this module and the issue it creates but unwilling to stand behind repairing it for free only offer a $125 discount on the repair. So im clear 1. vsa light comes on stays on and vsa switch will not turn this function off as it is designed to. 2. when you attempt to make rapid acceleration the vehicle will not respond just shutters. 3. you have to make a slow smooth acceleration up to your desired speed. 4. you also when backing the vehicle will hear a loud thud and feeling like you were rear ended due to the brakes locking and unlocking.							- Okc, OK, USA"

There was an auto care center 50 yards away so I slowly drove it there for an inspection. The mechanic lifted the vehicle and showed me that the back two rear subframe mounts were detached from the body which made the car inoperable. There was no visible rust on the undercarriage; the subframe mounts rusted from the inside out. My insurance company would not cover the damage as it was a rust issue. The car was irreparable so I had to total the car and received 10% of what the car was worth running from the junk yard. I purchased the Pilot new in Feb. 2006 and performed all the recommended Honda maintenance. I personal performed all oil and break jobs so I was familiar with the undercarriage of the car. I did not see any rust under the car that would have alerted me there was a potentially dangerous issue with the rear subframe.

I am the first owner of this SUV and noticed the problem during the very first year itself. That time my vehicle failed to stop on a stop sign. The problem I faced was when I applied brake, the car didn't stop and it continued in the acceleration mode and finally stopped after crossing the stop sign. I had reported this problem immediately to the Honda dealer, from where I purchased the vehicle. They inspected the vehicle and returned to me saying that they didn't find any problem. In fact they laughed at me that I didn't apply the brake properly. The dealer didn't document my concern. After that till now (almost 4 years) I am experiencing this kind of problem quite often. Because of this problem, I have to always make sure to brake an additional 2 or 3 feet ahead of my proposed stop as the vehicle may not stop where I think it should stop. If it does not stop, I brake harder and at that time I hear the acceleration is still on. I always ignored this problem mainly because this happens quite randomly like maybe a couple of times every month. I have not been able to figure out what exactly triggers this. Recently after reading about the Toyota recall, I have a feeling that my vehicle also has the similar problems and I notified the american Honda company. They actually didn't show much interest in addressing my problem mainly because my vehicle already has 52K miles and the warranty period (60K miles) will end soon.

Mr. Smith talked to the Honda service reps and they thought it was the vsa and probably wheel or yaw sensors. Buzz wanted to test drive to see if we could duplicate the problem. After about 20 very hard and fast turns (donuts almost), it duplicated the problem one time. He said that the vsa shuts everything down if it detects a major skid or G-force. The two times that it happened to my family was under very normal driving conditions while pulling into on-coming traffic on dry, clean pavement. They finally decided to send a instrument to hook up to the Pilot. When the problem happens again, I am to press a button to record a 30 second snap shot of what the vehicle was and is doing. I asked, what if we are in on-coming traffic"" their response, well, we have to duplicate the problem. I called Honda customer service at that point. I have now opened up a case"" for review with Honda. If you compare the way that the service manger was able to duplicate the problem to how it happened to my family, then there is no comparision.							- Olive Branch, MS, USA"

Barely 100 miles into my 2006 lease, I had to make an emergency stop on a rainy road due to an accident in front of me, and rear-ended a car when my ABS system failed to stop in time, despite the fact that my 2003 Pilot would have stopped at least 6 feet before the next vehicle. Knowing my 2003's stopping distance when ABS kicks in, I was flabbergasted that the new car didn't come close to stopping in time. I noticed one time since that the ABS system just doesn't compare to the 2003, and is extremely dangerous as a result. Another dangerous thing it has done twice is fishtail if I accelerate going into a turn or curve. The dealers service dep't used all kinds of computers to test the brakes, and took it out for a test drive, and said it functioned fine, and maybe I'm just not used to a 2wd. I told them I didn't want to drive this new car, it's not safe, and would rather hold on to my 2003 Pilot.

We bought a certified used Honda Pilot three years ago from Marysville Honda and now in a matter of days the transmission is more than likely shot along with the radiator. We noticed it was driving a little sluggish during acceleration at times last November as I was going back and fourth to the hospital for my sons chemo appointments. Driving the same roads and hills. I noticed it was a little sluggish during acceleration on the highway and when going up a hill/incline road. No other problems and no warning lights. The symptoms went away until last month the sluggish accelerating and automatic shifting was not smooth. Still no lights went on and the symptoms were not constant until last weekend the Check Engine light came on so we drove to auto zone for a diagnostic and codes were P0700 and P0741. Drove it home parked and started a google search which left me completely POd and amazed at how Honda has gotten by without NO RECALLS!!!! I saw countless postings on a variety of websites from angry Honda customers owning Pilots from 2003 to 2016! The same failed faulty transmissions, design flaws, faulty radiators. The same issues over and over again. I would have never paid this much for a used car if I would have known about the history of COSTLY failures in these Honda Pilots. Of course our warranty ran out last December so we tried taking the route that so many others have which was contacting the dealership at Marysville Honda where we bought the Pilot we still owe money on and explained we are aware there have been countless reports of Honda transmissions and radiators failing. We asked if they would help us out in getting this resolved. The service tech manager said your warranty is expired and we cannot help you. You can try to contact HOA Honda of America. This is the typical response I read that other Pilot owners got so I wasn't shocked but I was hoping for the best because having a reliable vehicle right now is critical. Since the coolant resovior was bubbling pink trans fluid that shouldn't be there the Honda tech was kind enough to tell us ""that's not good..... looks like your radiator is shot...don't drive it since the entire system will need to be flushed out....transmission fluid should never be in the engine...your looking at round $1,000"" This is when I did a google search on Honda radiators and found countless complaints as well. We had our Pilot towed to our neighborhood mechanic and he will be doing the flushing and replacing the radiator. I am so very done and disgusted with Honda!				- Tracie C.,				Columbus, OH, US"

We were driving at around 20 mph and as we gently braked in approach of the stop sign, the engine opened up nearly full throttle at just above 5000 rpms. My husband immediately and firmly applied the brake and placed the gear in park. With his foot on the brake, not the accelerator pedal, the engine continued to roar at 5000 rpms until he turned it off at the ignition after about 30 seconds. He restarted the engine and the engine RPM immediately shot up to 5000 rpms again, with his foot on the brake and the car in park. The tachometer stayed at the 5000 RPM level continuously until he again turned off the engine at the ignition after about 45 seconds. We waited a few more seconds and re-started the engine again. That time, the engine started at a normal RPM and we drove half a block to our house. We recorded a video of the second episode of 5000 rpms with a camera we had with us. We provided the video immediately to american Honda customer service. At the request of customer service, I took our Pilot to brickell Honda in miami on March 1. I showed the video of the sua to the service manager, george ruiz, on his computer. He was astounded by what he saw and expressed his genuine concern that the car was unsafe to operate, regardless of whether his service department was able to find the source of the problem. He said under no circumstance should the engine operate at 5000 rpms without the accelerator being depressed almost all the way to the floor. The district service manager, kevin mcclung, also inspected the car. American Honda determined the Pilot was operating within normal parameters. We were instructed to pick up the car on March 5 and did so on March 8. no repairs were performed.

I tested the car on a flat surface in the rain, and the front tire spinning still occurs. I tested the car on the same incline during dry road conditions, and the car rolls back once you take your foot off the brake. Took it into the dealership and took the mechanic for a test drive, he says the new 2006 Honda Pilot are all experience the same roll back and traction problems. Spoke with Honda's regional case manager on 3/6/06, his recommendations were to trade the car in for a 4 wd Pilot or learn to drive with both feet, your left on the brake and right foot on the gas so to ease the car and prevent roll back and loss of tire traction. They would report it to the Honda engineers, but I had no other options. I feel this is an extremely dangerous safety situation for me. There are many situations that I would be driving on an incline and roll back and loss of tire traction could cause an accident to cars behind me, or even pedestrians that may be crossing behind of me in a mall parking lot or any stacked parking lots that have ramps.							- Rancho Palos Verdes, CA, USA"

To my horror, I saw that he had tangled the seatbelt around his neck and was being lifted from his seat by it. My husband pulled off the road and we lunged back to release the belt. We then realized that he was not trapped by his own seatbelt but by the seatbelt designed for a center passenger in the second row. This belt comes down from the ceiling and connects at the seat to a latch designed without a quick release button. The latched belt had been resting against the seat behind my son's right shoulder. Playing with that belt, he had pulled it far enough to activate the retraction feature. Then he wrapped it around his head. When it began to tighten, he panicked, and it slipped down around his neck and tightened more. My husband and I grabbed the belt where it came out of the ceiling to stop it from retracting, but it was already too tight to get over his head. We were struggling to think straight. Neither of us knew how to detach the belt and we were trying to find something to cut it. Realizing the danger he was in, my son started squirming more. In calming him, we calmed ourselves a little. Thankfully, I remembered a friend mentioning he had found in the owner's manual how to detach the belt from the latch by sticking a key in a notch on the latch. I grabbed the keys from the ignition and popped the latch. My son was safe. Had only one parent been in the car, he would not have been able to hold the belt to keep it from retracting and reach the keys in the ignition - let alone find the very brief mention of this belt's operation in the user's manual. A driver could be unaware of this happening right behind him. My son nearly died with us helplessly standing by. Another child should not have to die for this design flaw to be recalled and corrected (www.ksl.com/index.php?nid=148&sid=2169050). Please recall this dangerous seatbelt configuration.

There was an auto care center 50 yards away so I slowly drove it there for an inspection. The mechanic lifted the vehicle and showed me that the back two rear subframe mounts were detached from the body which made the car inoperable. There was no visible rust on the undercarriage; the subframe mounts rusted from the inside out. My insurance company would not cover the damage as it was a rust issue. The car was irreparable so I had to total the car and received 10% of what the car was worth running from the junk yard. I purchased the Pilot new in Feb. 2006 and performed all the recommended Honda maintenance. I personal performed all oil and break jobs so I was familiar with the undercarriage of the car.

1513,Honda,Pilot,2006,suspension problems,NHTSA: Suspension,Pilot,"205,000 miles",,"			While recently driving my 2006 Honda Pilot on the highway, the vehicle seemed a little unsteady when cornering. After arriving home, the rear suspension looked too low and the negative camber of the rear wheels looked excessive. Closer inspection revealed the rear frame crossmember had extreme internal corrosion and both rear suspension mounting bolts had completely broken away from the frame (see included photos). The rear suspension had dropped several inches below the original mounting position and was pressing on the exhaust system. I question the safety of driving the vehicle in this condition and possibly has been and is an accident waiting to happen. Overall, the rest of the vehicle is in really good shape, has been well maintained, never been driven off-road or in harsh conditions and has never pulled heavy loads. The internal frame corrossion seems excessive for a vehicle of this age and perhaps the result of poor design, poor quality and/or inadequate corrosion protection. My local Honda dealer says this problem is unknown to them, is not fixable and there was nothing they can do at this time but refer me to Honda national. Honda national also initially claimed no knowledge of this problem even though numerous identical problems can be found on the NHTSA website as well as other online sources. A complaint and case number has now been registered with Honda for this problem. Unfortunately, this once great vehicle appears to be prematurely destined for the scrap metal pile.

Several warning lights lit up in the dashboard, there was a loud exhaust leak, and the car was no longer accelerating. There was an auto care center 50 yards away so I slowly drove it there for an inspection. The mechanic lifted the vehicle and showed me that the back two rear subframe mounts were detached from the body which made the car inoperable. There was no visible rust on the undercarriage; the subframe mounts rusted from the inside out. My insurance company would not cover the damage as it was a rust issue. The car was irreparable so I had to total the car and received 10% of what the car was worth running from the junk yard. I purchased the Pilot new in Feb. 2006 and performed all the recommended Honda maintenance. I personal performed all oil and break jobs so I was familiar with the undercarriage of the car. I did not see any rust under the car that would have alerted me there was a potentially dangerous issue with the rear subframe. A google search turned up several other Honda Pilot of this generation having the same subframe rust as mine with the same catastrophic failure of the rear mounts.

I told him that I was frightened and very disappointed that they were not doing something more to find and remedy the problem. A Honda customer service supervisor then contacted me to review the events and told me he would take the issue ""to the engineers"" because it was very unusual that 2 drivers would experience the same problem if it was driver error. He called back and told me that the engineers (who did not look at the car) said it was a problem called bridging, where you accidently put your foot on the gas pedal while braking. He did not address why neither one of us had ever experience ""bridging"" the first few years that we owned the car, when we both had driven it extensively at highway speeds. The car has 52K miles on it currently. This is a very dangerous problem and someone needs to deal with it before people are killed.

1549,Honda,Pilot,2006,wheels / hubs problems,NHTSA: Tires: Pressure Monitoring And Regulating Systems,Pilot,"35,000 miles",,"			Re: failures of tire valve stems 2006 Honda Pilot number of failures: 2 1. events leading to failures common filling of tires with high pressure air lead to disintegration of the valve stem. The valve stem separates at the threads for the valve cap, completely exposing the tire filler valve. 2. this event has occurred on two of the four operating tire valves in this 2006 Honda Pilot. There have been no consequences, but the exposure to tire valve failure from being exposed is obvious. 3. correction requires the complete replacement of the tire valve and its underlying tire pressure sending unit. Failure mode: This failure appears to be a result of the use of soft aluminum in the tire valve stem, the cutting of sharp, V-shaped threads on both the exterior to hold the valve cap and the interior to hold the valve and tire pressure sending unit. The sharply cut threads, compared to conically cut threads, results in fracture when the interior threads and exterior threads cross, leading to minimal metal between the interior and exterior. The failure in one case occurred when removing the valve cap, completely exposing the tire valve itself. The failure in the second case occurred when the high pressure air filling valve (brass) adhered to the very sharp exterior threads and simply ripped the valve stem apart. Note that the valve stem is composed of a soft aluminum, rather than hardened brass or steel. I bring this to NHTSA since, in my opinion, there is a real possibility that these valve stem failures can lead to rapid deflation of the subject tire, loss of operator control, and consequent accident and injury if the valve stem separates such that the integrity of the tire valve is damaged. In my estimation, this is as significant a problem as was the historic sudden tire tread separation issue. In fact, this problem can result in the same unexpected loss of tire integrity if the tire valve is damaged subsequent to a failure in the valve threads.							- Fort Collins, CO, USA"

The latching mechanism is only being held in place (in a confined area) by the plastic paneling of the car. Since the latch is no longer attached to the frame, the movement of the mechanism determines if the rear hatch is going to latch or not. When it is latched, the only item securing the mechanism is the plastic paneling. The mechanism itself is not defective or broken however; the way the mechanism has been secured seems to be the issue.

I even spoke with a Service Manager, and he said the same thing. I have called Honda Care and after a very lengthy discussion with them, I know realize that HONDA DOESN'T CARE!! They offered no financial assistance in replacing my 4TH BROKEN WINDOW REGULATOR, said that no recalls have been issued, and that there are no 'known' issues with the regulators. They also tried to tell me that the problem is probably due to the high mileage on my vehicle - what??? Mileage has nothing to do with the 'window function' and certainly doesn't explain why the first regualtor had to be replaced when mileage was under 30K. Honda Care Rep also told me that I would need to take it to a Honda dealership for repair IF I wanted to have any chance of having the issue 'reviewed' for further resolution. Problem with that - Honda Dealership was $100 higher to fix issue vs. local Certified Honda repair shop that was 'independently' owned - because I chose to have the problem fixed for the lower cost, Honda said they would 'close' my ticket.

The Honda service technician had called me back a few hours later to report a hole on my condenser that was not repairable and required to be replaced. This repair by Honda is apparently not covered under Honda care warranty. On the Honda care website, it clearly shows that the condenser is covered under warranty repair. There is no ""fine print"" indicating otherwise. Honda claims that the damage was due to a ""foreign object"" like a rock or pebble while the vehicle was in motion. I strongly believe there is a serious design flaw with the vehicle. The front grill is an open design that exposes the radiator and A/C condenser unit. It is very clear that while the vehicle is in motion, there is the strong possibility that any ""foreign object"" can hit that are. Honda had quoted me at $700+ dollars on the cost of the repair. I believe that this is absolutely ridiculous that the repair cost must fall on the consumer to pay out of pocket expenses on a repair that is clearly not at fault of any driver and is due to a design flaw on the vehicle.

1609,Honda,Pilot,2007,engine problems,Excessive Oil Consumption,Pilot EXL V6,Automatic transmission,"175,000 miles"," I thought Hondas were supposed to last forever. I HAD a 2007 with 175K miles on it that I babied with every intention of keeping it until at least 250,000 miles. About a year and a half ago, the guys changing my oil started telling me my oil was low. Keep in mind I always, without fail, had the oil changed between 15-30% remaining life. I once asked a trusted mechanic why the oil would be low between changes if no warning lights were coming on. He said sometimes older engines just burn oil. But I've never once had any sort of leak or spotting under the car. Several weeks ago, my husband checked the oil (between changes and I still had 50% oil life remaining) and there was NOTHING on the stick. He added two quarts and I went on my merry way. A couple weeks later, I was driving down the road and the low oil pressure light started blinking. No weird engine sounds, no oil leaks. I pulled over and googled why the light might suddenly come on and, based on what I read, headed over for a full oil change about 2 miles down the road. They said there was no oil left and noted the engine was making a kind of weird noise. Up until that point, there had been no weird noises, and in fact, I had just had it in a week earlier to an outstanding mechanic to replace the radiator and hoses. No other issues. After the oil change I drove about 1/2 a mile toward the our mechanic's garage and it died. Long story short, had the Pilot towed and the engine was blown - something along the lines of rear cam was bent (most likely due to the low oil pressure) which shredded the timing belt (which had been changed 60,000 miles earlier) and bent the valves. For $4500, I could have a new, used engine installed. At first I beat myself up thinking I should have done something more to prevent this, only to find THIS today:https://www.carcomplaints.com/Honda/Pilot/2010/engine/excessive_oil_consumption.shtmlandhttp://www.hondaproblems.com/excessive-oil-consumption/ as I was considering buying a used 2010.

As I had the brakes on the car immediately stopped as it should, but the engine RPM increased significantly for a couple seconds and then returned to normal idle RPM. This establishes this problem as an engine acceleration issue and not a braking problem. Of course being an intermittent problem they could find nothing wrong.

The Honda service technician had called me back a few hours later to report a hole on my condenser that was not repairable and required to be replaced. This repair by Honda is apparently not covered under Honda care warranty. On the Honda care website, it clearly shows that the condenser is covered under warranty repair. There is no ""fine print"" indicating otherwise. Honda claims that the damage was due to a ""foreign object"" like a rock or pebble while the vehicle was in motion. I strongly believe there is a serious design flaw with the vehicle. The front grill is an open design that exposes the radiator and A/C condenser unit. It is very clear that while the vehicle is in motion, there is the strong possibility that any ""foreign object"" can hit that are. Honda had quoted me at $700+ dollars on the cost of the repair. I believe that this is absolutely ridiculous that the repair cost must fall on the consumer to pay out of pocket expenses on a repair that is clearly not at fault of any driver and is due to a design flaw on the vehicle. I would like the NHTSA to investigate this matter. I've done some research and apparently there is already a class action lawsuit involving the 2004-2007 Honda Odyssey vehicle lineup that has a very similar issue with an open front grill design.							- Staten Island, NY, USA"

Although, the gauges did not indicate overheating and I did not observe antifreeze coolant leaking, the odor was becoming extremely strong. I was not able to get into the Honda dealership so I brought my vehicle to a big O tire store to inspect the coolant system. It was first diagnosed as a core engine heater problem. However, after disassembling the vehicle, it was discovered that a hose leading to the rear ac/heating system was leaking. According to the mechanic, the factory placed the clamp over the hose and not over the nozzle. This directly led to the puncture of the hose and subsequent leakage of antifreeze throughout the entire flooring of my vehicle. A request to american Honda to reimburse me for the repair was dismissed since I did not bring my vehicle into a Honda dealer.

1700,Honda,Pilot,2007,electrical problems,NHTSA: Electrical System,Pilot 6-cyl,"99,100 miles",,"			While driving with headlights on during daylight hours, we noticed a burning smell as we arrived at our destination. It was dark when we returned home and the headlights seemed very dim when using low beams. We were in a very rural area and able to use high beams for most of the trip. When switching to low beams due to oncoming traffic, I had difficulty seeing the road. When we reached the highway and had to use low beams more, it was obvious something was wrong. I used high beams as much as possible. At one point, I switched to low beams as a car passed me. The lights were dim again but suddenly brightened up a second after switching to low beams (possibly due to a bump in the road?) and I realized we had been driving with only fog lights for the past 30 minutes. Without the fog lights, we definitely would have crashed when we dimmed our high beams on the rural roads earlier in the trip. The following day, I turned on the headlights and the low beams were not working. Tapping on the lens sometimes temporarily fixes the problem, so the burning smell may not have been connected to the loss of lights. The sudden onset of this problem is a major safety hazard and seems very similar to the problem experienced with headlights in several other models, including 2003-2005 Pilot. The previous recall (NHTSA action number : EA11012 NHTSA recall campaign number : 12V136000) was specific to 2 bulb systems. The 2007 Pilot uses a 4 bulb system, but the problem seems similar and I don't have access to any technical information that would explain why the 4 bulb system is immune to the problem.

The dealer told us the 2 steering bolts were sheared off. They do not know the cause. They note: The bolts are not visible during inspections. The steering and subframe must be replaced. The vsa etc. Are probably fine but we cannot know until everything else is fixed. The dealer has declined to put this in writing. They say there is not anybody at Honda with whom we can discuss this. When asked, they knew of no relevant recalls. There has been no accident or other damage to the car. It is kept in our garage. We have maintained it (last service was Sep 2013). We are fortunate we did not have an accident. Even after the proposed fixes, will the car be safe? on the NHTSA site, we found 2012/2013 recalls for the 2005 Pilot for the same subsystems and similar symptoms.							- Seattle, WA, USA"

It was dark when we returned home and the headlights seemed very dim when using low beams. We were in a very rural area and able to use high beams for most of the trip. When switching to low beams due to oncoming traffic, I had difficulty seeing the road. When we reached the highway and had to use low beams more, it was obvious something was wrong. I used high beams as much as possible. At one point, I switched to low beams as a car passed me. The lights were dim again but suddenly brightened up a second after switching to low beams (possibly due to a bump in the road?) and I realized we had been driving with only fog lights for the past 30 minutes. Without the fog lights, we definitely would have crashed when we dimmed our high beams on the rural roads earlier in the trip. The following day, I turned on the headlights and the low beams were not working. Tapping on the lens sometimes temporarily fixes the problem, so the burning smell may not have been connected to the loss of lights. The sudden onset of this problem is a major safety hazard and seems very similar to the problem experienced with headlights in several other models, including 2003-2005 Pilot. The previous recall (NHTSA action number : EA11012 NHTSA recall campaign number : 12V136000) was specific to 2 bulb systems.

The driver was able to pull over to the side of the road. The failure occurred without warning. Roadside assistance was called to the scene and the vehicle was towed to an authorized dealer for diagnostic testing. The dealer stated that the failure was related to the factory clip attached to the clamp of the transmission line. There was excessive fluid leaking from the transmission. The clip should have been removed by the manufacturer at the time of the vehicle's production. The vehicle was repaired.

I spoke with a representative at Michelin tires and they said if I were to be in a remote location they would send a tire out to me & pay for accommodations until I received the tires. Honda & Michelin are not set up to provide the consumer with service/accessibility to maintain this tire.

I have 3 small children and now have to be concerned about getting a flat tire in a remote location, and fear for our personal safety. I choose now to only travel near major cities. Honda said I would need new rims & tires... and they do not seem to want to help. I am hoping you can provide me with a contact or give me some info on how to get these tires off my vehicle. Also shouldn't Honda be willing to replace a product that has issues associated with it. When I had my flat tire I took my car to 3 tire shops and was told they would not touch the pax-tire & they had no plans on acquiring the equipment to fix them because it was too expensive and not enough vehicles have the tire system to make it cost effective. Honda first needs to better inform the consumer what they are getting into and the issues associated with this tire system... second they need to provide those of us who don't want the tires a way to switch them out.

Luckily had the radio turned down and started to notice a kind of tea pot boiling sound. I looked down at the dash, no warning lights were on, but to my astonishment the temperature gauge was pegged past H. I immediately got off the road were I could and shut it off. At this point I could hear the coolant boiling and then it died down. Looked under the hood and there was a dark green sludge that had erupted from the coolant overflow tank. Looked at the oil dipstick and this same sludge was there. Had it towed to the Honda dealer.They diagnosed it as blown head gaskets ~approx $2200-2300, unless they had to machine the head then it would be more. Asked service rep what caused this problem, reply was that this unfortunately happens sometimes. This car has been dealer serviced since new and only had 33,000 miles on it. Last service was 7 months ago. I have owned 6 other Hondas over the years ('82 Accord was first) and never had anything like this happen. All my Hondas had mid-100K miles on them and were all sold in good shape. None had problems of this magnitude especially so young in miles. I am really mad that this has happened. This was supposed to be the same engine that is put in Acura vehicles.I will contact American Honda and complain about this problem.As an aid in seeing the overheating problem earlier on future designed vehicles, a warning light should be put on the dash that would come on when engine overheats. The gauge is ok but you have to be tuned into looking at it. You should have the gauge and the idiot light.

The car slowed down some, I drove my car to a mechanic and he stated that the oil blew into the coolant. Car did not overheat.I have 69,000 miles and still owe on the Pilot. The Honda dealer states since I brought my car to another shop, that it voids any warranty and they used a machine that Honda does not recommend to flush coolant. Honda states I need a new engine and it will cost $7,000 to repair.We have talked with both of the Honda dealerships in town and they state they will not help. We have filed a complaint with Corporate and they give us the same story the dealer did. We are going to contact an attorney. We have spoken to a mechanic and he thinks that our pilot had a defective engine. Honda states they have never had any problems like this before.

So i tell my Dad in law he's a mechanic by trade and he tells me to switch up the oil from 5-30 to 10-30 full synthetic, synthetic is all I've ever used on that peace of trash. Anyway i do an oil change again n still the same. I know now the problem is the rings. I never expected this from HONDA i paid close to $18,000. I went online and every freakin year of Honda was recalled except mine, almost every other year of every make has been recalled, and i know this problem is a factory defect.

1876,Honda,Pilot,2008,body / paint problems,Rust Bubbles On Roof,Pilot,Automatic transmission,"56,809 miles"," In September 2011, I noticed that my 2008 Honda Pilot had multiple rust bubbles at different locations on the roof. On October 7th 2011, I brought it to the Honda Dealership where the SUV was purchased, Honda Ile-Perrot, and was told that the rust was due to stone chips. I was told that it was no longer under guarantee and that I would have to pay approximately $1,100.00 cad to have it repaired at the dealership. I told the service manager that it was impossible that it was stone chips since most of the bubbles were on the middle of my roof and that they had probably been there for a few months but I hadn't noticed them due to their location. I only measure 5 feet, 5 inches so I do not see the roof of the Pilot when I use it on a daily basis! I was also very badly treated by the Service Manager and was referred to as a ""little lady"". The Pilot had 91,000 kms on October 7th 2011. I was extremely upset so I decided to drive to a new Honda dealership closer to my home, Honda Vaudreuil, the same day. The service lady there came to see my SUV and told me that they were in fact not due to stone chips and that she had never seen a problem like this before on a Honda Pilot 2008. She told me to call Honda Canada Customer Relations at 1-800-946-6329 to open a file in order to have the rust bubbles taken off and the roof repainted free of charge. She told me that since I was technically over the guarantee time limit of 3 years, I had to go through Honda Canada. That afternoon I called Honda Canada Customer Relations and opened a file with them with the help of Honda Vaudreuil (they sent photos of the rust bubbles). After more than 2 months, I finally got a response that my request was denied and there was nothing Honda Canada was willing to do in order to help me (eg: lower the cost of the reapirs). During my conversation with the Honda Customer Relations employee, I was accused of not taking proper care of my vehicule and was also told that the soap that I used to wash my vehicule might have caused the rust bubbles-----HOW RIDICULOUS! The dealership, Honda Vaudreuil, was only willing to reduce the price of the repair to $750.00 cad plus taxes. Still too expensive in my opinion.It has been over one year since this incident and I am still extremely mad. I have not had the rust bubbles fixed yet since I feel I should not have to pay for Honda's poor choice of roof metal/paint.I have made complaints to the dealership, Honda Ile Perrot, and to Honda Canada and have gotten no where. Is there anything else I can do to get things moving?				- melb74,				St-Lazare, Quebec, canada"

Issue happened in store parking lot loading groceries; tailgate would not latch shut and drove home at slow speed with all dome lights on (Honda does not give a position switch option for on*door as I have seen in many other vehicles owned). Due to serious safety issue of having unlatched tailgate opted to effect immediate repair upon return to home address. I have reinstalled all 3 screws and used blue loctite thread lock as it appears no thread lock was previously used. I am a mechanical engineer and was concerned that a) very small diameter screws relative to size of item being secured and B) no locking mechanism to hold torque on the screws. There are many complaints of various Honda models with similar issue on internet at Honda owner discussion boards. There are even step by step instructions with photos how to fix posted on a Honda owners discussion board; yet when I check Honda's official tsb list - there is not even 1 tsb for the tailgate latch loose issue; so it is likely many owners (as myself) have opted to take the diy approach for the solution. My professional opinion is this is poorly designed since the attachment mechanism (3 screws) to hold the latch body to the tailgate panel could become loose from nominal in-city daily driving (proof that the torque on the fasteners is not holding under normal use).							- Boise, ID, USA"

About two months later a faint popping noise could be hear from the front driver's side. After several trips (more than 3) to the dealer they could not pinpoint location of noise and car would not consistently make sound. In Dec. 2008 it was determined that the popping sound was coming from the steering column. The dealer ordered and replaced the part Feb. 2009. After replacing the part the dealer test drove it and could not hear the noise anymore. I picked up my car, however, after driving it started to make the noise and I listened carefully over the days and the popping noise was coming right back. I am not totally convinced that the dealer ordered and replaced the part. I am calling Honda Motors Corp. On mon., Mar. 9, 2009, to voice my complaint that the car is defective and poses a hazard. I do not want the steering wheel to come apart while I am driving. I noticed that this web page posted a recall of the 2005 Honda Pilot for steering column improperly assembled.

1978,Honda,Pilot,2008,steering problems,NHTSA: Steering,Pilot,"16,000 miles",,"			Driving at slow speed in parking lot, while making a turn to the right with steering wheel close to full right turn lock. Keys on key ring caught within recess in the back of the steering wheel (recess is exposed to keys because of right turn), and lodged against casing that contains the key assembly, with the result of the steering wheel completely locking in the right turned position while moving, causing complete loss of steering control. I was able to stop the car without accident since no car was in the parking spaces at that time. Was only able to remove jammed key/steering wheel condition (after stopping) when Honda key broke, releasing the electronic portion of key from the metal portion, allow the wedging of the other key to release. Combination of keys on key ring and low speed full right turn cause the dangerous condition. Dangerous condition for other motorist with many keys (8) on relatively small key ring, allowing some keys on ring to point towards steering wheel rather than downwards. Honda should either plug the recess in steering wheel, or provide shielding to prevent keys from contacting back of the steering wheel.

Other Honda dealerships/service have quoted comparable pricing or higher.It was sheer luck that I wasn’t traveling at highway speeds when this accident occurred; that I was able to pull over off the road; that no collision occurred with other vehicles; and, ultimately, that no one was hurt.This is the 3rd Honda I've owned in a row, in fact the only model car I've ever purchased. I bought it used with 40K miles on it from the original owner, a family member who bought it new. I have all service records for the car, however the service was minimal as it was a new car with low mileage (89K when the accident occurred).I'm facing a $7K repair to put in an engine with more mileage than my current car in it, just to keep it running for (hopefully) a few more years and hope this same issue does not occur again. The dealership and I both submitted cases to Honda with no goodwill assistance to fix because ""the car was out of warranty"" due to age (not mileage). They were rejected. I had no known oil leaks but we had remarked how frequently we needed oil changes on this vehicle; I wonder if it isn't the engine in this lawsuit:http://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA913971022.PDFhttp://www.autonews.com/assets/PDF/CA913981022.PDFHonda, what a disappointment in your ""safe,"" ""reliable"" cars.

First told it was spark plugs, later told it was engine failure and would cost $8,000 to $12,000 to replace engine. Informed them we had extended warranty that covered up to 150,000 miles and then told it would have to be investigated to determine what caused engine failure. After 2 1/2 weeks of investigation we were told it would not be covered under the extended warranty. Stated they think a spark plug broke off and fell into engine! OK, we didn't break it off and put it there. We don't know what caused the spark plug to break. This vehicle was supposed to have 100,000 mile spark plugs in it and we had to have all spark plugs replaced in it at 35,000 miles which we still have the maintenance ticket for. Why is Honda selling a vehicle with an engine that is not going to last much longer than 100,000 miles and why are they selling extended warranties that aren't going to cover a major malfunction of this sort. We have had many Hondas over the years. This is our last. Believe me, our friends, business acquaintances and and anyone else we know, will certainly know that we would never recommend a Honda. Just seems strange and unfair that the service department would tell you that your cars engine has failed, then after investigation they can't really find the source of failure, and you are left with a vehicle that should have lasted at least another 100,000 miles that is worthless.

2022,Honda,Pilot,2009,engine problems,Engine Turns Over But Won't Start,Pilot EX-L,Automatic transmission,757 miles,"We bought our new 2009 Pilot on February 2, 2009 and on February 20, 2009 we took the car back to the Honda dealership service department to have our brand new car serviced because we had trouble with the car starting properly. The problem that was occurring is when you get in the car and put the key in the ignition, sometimes the car starts absolutely perfectly, other times the car will crank, like it's trying to turn over to start for a range of 5-15 seconds, which then the car with eventually start up. This does not happen every time we start the car it's very sporadic. We took the car into the dealership to get looked at on the 20th of February and they said that they could not find anything wrong and to take it home and if it does it again to bring it back. On that trip into service they reset the entire battery and rewired it and also had the alarm people make sure the alarm was not causing the problem. We were told that if we can just get the problem to reproduce in front of them that's what they need to see happen so that they can hear it and know what they are dealing with.The 2nd time we took the car back to the dealership was on February 23, 2009. This time into the shop they were advised by Honda to completely reset the entire computer system in the car. We were given a rental car, a Kia Spectra. They reset the computer and the next day sent us home with the car again and said if the car did it again to bring it back. The 3rd time, for the same problem, on March 3, 2009, the car went back to the dealership and they decided to hook a computer up to the car, the Honda Interface Module or HIM. They put us in a rental car, a Chrysler Town and Country Mini Van and we had the dealership cover the insurance as well, and then had us return the next day, March 4th, to take the car home with the computer on it to have the computer track everytime we start the car and it will record what the car does every time it is started. This time we were leaving on vacation after getting our car back and we had the starting issue happen 2 times before we left, so in less than 12 hours from leaving the dealership. Our friends started the car everyday while we were gone to get the problem to happen and they had it happen 4 times and the 5th time they attempted to start the car the battery was completely dead! So from my vacation I got to call the dealership and tell them the problem, then I got to call and arrange for a tow truck to come and get our car out of our garage while we are gone, and also had to arrange for friends to be there at 7am on Friday, March 13th. The 4th time to the dealership was when the car got towed there on Friday, March 13th. We got home from the airport and the dealership was suppose to have a rental car for us at the airport and they failed to do that. So we had to call the dealership and get the rental car taken care of ourselves just to get home from vacation! This time we said we required them to give us an SUV so we were given a Ford Expedition and the dealership covered the insurance as well. Then back to the dealership the next day to get car. When we got there they told us that they had to put a brand new battery in the car because it was completely dead. They said they think that their computer (HIM) had completely drained the battery and when the battery died all the information from the HIM was completely erased. So they wanted us to take the car home again with the HIM on it to track each start so that they could get their data if it happened again. So we left with the car from the dealership at 12:30pm and headed home. The car had the problem when starting at 7pm and 8:10pm that night, March 13th. The service at the dealership closed at 7pm so we couldn't take the car back that day and they are closed on Sundays so we took the car back to them on Monday morning, March 16th.This is the 5th trip to the dealership now for the same problem on March 16, 2009, and they downloaded the computer and said there was no information on it. We talked with the General Manager, Joe, who has been working with us on the car and all the difficulties we have been having and asked him what they were going to do about it. He said we can't do anything until we have data. We said that the problem keeps occurring and their computer is not recording any data and how is that our fault? So he wanted us to leave with the car again to get the car to reproduce the problem for the computer to try and record again and we told him no. So he put us in a rental car again, the same Ford Expedition that we had just returned and they are covering the insurance again on it. The 5 hours that we were there at the dealership that day trying to get Joe to do something for us got us nowhere. During this time we were there my husband, Robert, was going down to service, where our car was located, and was working with our service provider, John, on starting the car every once in a while to see if the problem would reproduce. They had it happen in a very minor fashion while we were there and their computer showed nothing again. So as we were leaving my husband started the car again one last time before we left in the rental and the car had the problem the worst we had ever experienced it! We yelled to get everyone's attention that was in the service area and it was heard by many people, including our service provider John. As the car cranked and cranked to start for about 20 seconds or so at the end of that the cranking trailed off and the car never started up. The battery was completely dead again!! In 2 days the brand new battery was completely dead! So the John had his crew immediately get a back up power source and extract the information from the HIM to get the data. Once again, they said there was no data. So John said, I know exactly what it sounds like and what was happening so go ahead and take the rental and go home. Having this happen right there in the service area is exactly what they told us they needed on time 1 into service for this problem. So they have their information or data as Joe keeps asking for. But this is not satisfactory for them it seems. Joe said that he was going to have his Area Service Rep come out the next day as well as his Head Training Service Tech to work on the car. On March 17, 2009 we called to John in service and asked what was going on with the car. He said that they jump started the car and the battery is holding a charge for now, the Head Training Service Tech was there working with the car trying to get the problem to reproduce again to get data on the HIM. So during all of this Joe was taking our car out and driving it and then parking it and waiting for approximately 2 hours and then starting it. Problem did not occur so he took it out and drove it again and did the same things all over in a cycle. No problems all day. So when my husband got off work for the day he drove up to the dealership to find out what was going on. The Area Service Rep had only been there a couple of hours and then left so my husband did not get to meet with her, he talked to Joe while up there and said he wanted to talk to the Head Training Service Tech to brainstorm or hear what he thinks is going on. Joe never took Robert to talk to him. Joe said that he wanted Robert to take the car home with the HIM attached again to get the problem to reproduce so they can get the data. He said no, I am not going to keep doing this. He asked them to try something else if they are not going to proceed with the Lemon Law and Magnesson Moss Warranty Act for us and Joe said no, this is what we are going to keep trying. We have to have data on that computer before we will do anything else. So Robert told Joe to keep the car there, drive it wherever he wants to and to call us when they have either found the problem and completely fixed it to 100% or when he has a replacement car. So the Pilot is still at the dealership as of today and the General Manager is driving it during the day and also driving it home at night.Basically we are tired of going in circles on this, we fully qualify under the Lemon Law and the Magnesson Moss Warranty Act but have been trying to give the dealership time to fix the problem. This has been going on for far too long with no results or anything from the dealership. They are not willing to budge on what they are going to try and how they are going to help us and we are really fed up. We are paying $649 a month for a car that we don't even have! We bought this car 7 weeks ago and have had nothing but problems and headaches with it. We live 40 miles from the dealership and that is where all the mileage on the car has come from. When we drove it off the lot it had 17 miles on it and as of yesterday it had 1386. I do not work so this car should have about half of that mileage on it. All the miles are driving to and from the dealership the 9 times we have driven up there in it. We are wasting a lot of our time with our daughter in this and also away from our home, which we are in the process of trying to sell, and also expecting another baby. We don't need this stress and lack of sleep, first for health reasons for me and the unborn baby, but also for our 14 month old daughter and my husband having to work 12 hours a day! We bought a brand new car for peace of mind and reliability and having something very nice to drive and we have yet gotten to really experience that. All we are looking for is getting a replacement car and to move on with our lives and be happy! We absolutely LOVE the Honda Pilot and just want a working model of what we are paying for and what we are responsible for through our insurance.				- Katie Z.,				Aurora, CO, US"

2028,Honda,Pilot,2009,engine problems,Engine Knocking,Pilot LX V6,Automatic transmission,"85,000 miles"," engine knocking at 2500+ ramsPlease forgive me if I misname some parts. I am marginally knowledgeable about these things. I like to say I know just enough to be dangerous.I purchased my 2009 Pilot LX, V6 3.5, used from a private party with ~65K. I take great pride in my vehicles and performing proper maintenance. I have the oil changed every 3K with a synthetic blend of 5W30. I used a very good and trusted local mechanic with many years of experience on all kinds of vehicles with engines, but mostly cars and trucks. He is the most trusted mechanic in the county.I have owned it for two years. Recently, at about 85K I noticed a loud knocking noise when accelerating, starting at 2500+rpms. It mostly dissipates at 3000+rpms. The noise is extremely faint at idle and all other rpms. My mechanic and I did some research and checked service bulletins. We discovered that this is a known issue, at least to some. There was a similar posting on a website called piloteers.org. In layman's terms, apparently the shafts the rocker arms pivot on were outsourced by Honda in 2009-2010 engines, and these tubes/shafts have developed too much slack and are shifting, causing misalignment between the rockers and cam.My mechanic said that at this time this is only occurring on the ""back"" set of cylinders (1, 2, 3?). He followed service bulletin recommendations to remove and re-torque the rocker arm shafts, and adjusted the valves. Apparently this resolved the issue for some owners. Unfortunately, it has not for me.Now, he is going to have to dig back into it. Replacing the rocker arm shafts may resolve it, but it is too difficult to determine if there has been damaging wear and tear on the camshaft and rockers, so we are replacing those as well. The repair also requires the removal of the timing belt, which isn't recommended for this vehicle until it reaches 105K. I am going to go ahead replace the timing belt now, however. I am frustrated to experience such a significant engine issue before I even have to replace the timing belt. To me, this is uncharacteristic of Honda's reputation for quality engineering.Apparently Honda has not yet acknowledged it, accept responsibility, or offer mitigation for repair. When I call the local dealer they claimed not knowledge of this issue. I contacted Honda USA Customer Service. They, too, denied knowledge of this problem. It sounds like it may take a class-action lawsuit, much like their ""Honda Engine Misfire Settlement"" did. A judge in this case forced a warranty extension. See Honda Service Bulletin #13-082.Once the repair is complete I will report back with additional details.Update from Aug 2, 2016: The noise continued to worsen.  My mechanic did some more digging around and now thinks the seals/bearings on the crankshaft are shot.  He recommended replacing the engine, as he said replacing these requires a near complee engine dismantle, there is not guarantee the repair will hold, and for that kind of money and risk I am better off buying a good used junkyard engine or a re-manufactured engine.				- jkw0376,				Coralville, IA, US"

But vehicle never made it for an oil change without adding/tapping off two 1 quarts of engine oil. This is the second time I had called them about the issue. The first time I brought the vehicle to the dealer to check they had the oil change done and said to return back after 1000 miles to check the oil. Result to that they concluded that the oil burn is within the normal range. But the remainder of this oil change resulted to me tapping off two 1 quart engine oil with 30% oil life left. Research shows that a lot of similar model is experiencing excessive oil burn as well. The dealer mentioned that the cost to fix the issue is around $3,800! I want the manufacturer to release this issue to the public as a recall and to offer to fix the problem free of charge. This is definitely a design/manufacturer defect. This brand was said to be known for reliability but not really and I don't think so. I consider not buying this brand again and definitely will won't recommend.							- Owings Mills, MD, USA"

I was driving with my two children in the rear of the vehicle, at approximately 30mph. With no warning the car made a noise, several warning lights illuminated on the dashboard, and I lost control of the car as all acceleration, steering, braking, et cetera, ceased operation. I was able to coast to the shoulder but was still in the road, where I put on my emergency lights and with my children climbed out of the car on the passenger side. Aaa towed the Pilot to the tameron Honda dealership in hoover, Alabama. They called me the next day, Friday, January 12, to say that the rear cam on the engine had seized, causing the timing belt to slip and causing irreparable damage to the engine. The recommended fix: Replace the engine with a used engine, plus the water pump and timing belt, at a cost of $6,914.50 it was sheer luck that I wasn't traveling at highway speeds when this accident occurred; that I was able to pull over nearly off the road; that no collision occurred with other vehicles; and, ultimately, that no one was hurt. I purchased this car in fall of 2014 with 40,000 miles on it from the original owner. Maintained the car with (and have record of) oil changes, recalls, battery, brake and tire replacement, all at licensed repair shops. This vehicle currently has 89,109 miles on it. I am concerned with replacing the engine with another used engine of the same type, as recommended, as the same situation could occur. This particular vehicle was the impetus for a class action lawsuit, the Honda misfire engine settlement, settled in March 2014, prior to my purchase of the car. It involved several classes of Honda vehicles over a range of years, including mine, that have V-6, variable cylinder management (vcm) engines.

I am 55 years old and have changed numerous tires over the years. I located the jack, spare tire, loosened the lug nuts and jacked the SUV on the passenger jack point. After removing the flat tire, the car tilted forward and fell off the jack. This was a relatively level road. Repeated this after setting the parking brake and chocking the rear wheels and it happened again. Third time, set the jack at an angle and at the point where the SUV was high enough to put the spare tire on, it happened again. Finally put a 1-2 inch flat rock under the jack and was finally able to keep it get the SUV high enough and stable enough to put the spare on. Note that the base of the jack is approximately 3 inches square and the jack goes to the maximum height it can to be able to jack the SUV. This is the same jack that is in all other Honda. Luckily noone was hurt except for the car - bent rotor, wheel bearing alignment and rocker panel pierced by the jack. Contacted Honda, got a case number, after the Honda dealer had performed repairs contacted them. Two weeks later spoke with the case officer and they informed me that this is a warranty issue and that the car was out of warranty and not covered for any damage. The dealer should have inspected the jack (neither the dealer nor I knew of this) and even if the jack was defective, as the car was out of warranty nothing would be covered. I indicated that this was a safety issue and not a warranty one. They indicated that if someone had been injured, an attorney would know who to contact at Honda but as an owner, it is up to them whether or not to honor any recalls or safety issues. Even the dealer was amazed at this! the jack is not designed for this heavy and tall of a vehicle, and Honda should do something about it before the SUV lands on someone's hand, foot or leg.							- Malvern, PA, USA"

I was told that the brake rotors had warped and that I would have to have them resurfaced at a cost of $265.07. Mind you I fully understand how the driver’s habits can have an effect on the brakes (ie. Dragging your foot on the brake pedal). I have never had an issue with brake wear on any of my vehicles in 30 some years of driving. Since Honda considers rotors a wearable item it would not be covered under warranty. Although I know that rotors are a wearable item I didn't expect them to warp at only 24,000 miles. This is possibly an issue similar to the problem Honda has had with thier Accord. When I attempted to seek redress from Honda I was told that the manufacturers warranty would only cover the rotors for 12,000 miles. Which leads me to believe that Honda feels it is perfectly acceptable for rotors to have to be resurfaced(turned) every 12,000 miles or so. This is my first Honda and I was under the impression that I was buying a quality vehicle.

So I told the servicer that this will be a chronic problem since all the rotors will warp even if I replace them or have the current rotors turned. He said warranty expires at 12,000 miles for brake problems and it was my choice. Wow! I ask them to still check it and when the service invoice was printed the writing was perform a complimentary vehicle inspection including inspecting the tire pressure and setting it to factory specification. Nothing written about the steering wheel shimmie. So I pointed it out and the servicer said it was inside the free inspection. They know its a problem and there is a deliberate effort to hide it.

Honda said when the sensor was not working, I did not have ABS or the other features. But, sent me home with the car saying it was safe; not sure this was true.

This is a warning to all Honda V6 owners with VCM technology. Get rid of the vehicle before this happens to you. There is no permanent solution from Honda. The repairs will not correct the problem since it is an inherent design flaw in the VCM system. They are simply Band-Aid solutions. See the video at the website vcmdisable.com.

I was driving down 285 in the far left lane...speeding at 80...my usual...when all of a sudden my truck wouldn't take gas. I was forced to pull over on the left shoulder because no one in GA will let you over in the right lane when you are having car problems. Anyways...when I stop the vehicle it stalled. I quickly started the vehicle back up but it shortly died again. Now I am panicking cause people aren't really seeing me stalled until they are right on my bumper. I tried to start the car again...it started for a second then stalled. It took DOT 15 minutes to get to me and safely get me to the right shoulder. They pushed me out of the way and when I was to the side of the road the dang thing started and stayed on. I wasn't low on fuel, but I decided to fill the tank all the way up just incase it had something to do with that. I took my Pilot to the dealership to have them check it out and they kept my vehicle for 4 days and couldn't figure out what was wrong.

The steering wheel has been shaking for a while. It has been more pronounce as time gone on. So I went to the dealer today and was explained it was the rotor being warped. It was explained the manufacturer went to a softer material to eliminate squeaking brake sounds with a harder material. So I told the servicer that this will be a chronic problem since all the rotors will warp even if I replace them or have the current rotors turned. He said warranty expires at 12,000 miles for brake problems and it was my choice. Wow! I ask them to still check it and when the service invoice was printed the writing was perform a complimentary vehicle inspection including inspecting the tire pressure and setting it to factory specification. Nothing written about the steering wheel shimmie. So I pointed it out and the servicer said it was inside the free inspection. They know its a problem and there is a deliberate effort to hide it. I am not satisfy with the answer or service. The technician heard the problem, but this time they dug deeper and agreed that there was something wrong with the power steering rack. They replaced it and my Pilot is like new! hopefully Honda will stand behind their product better in the future -- I had to go through much frustration to get my problem fixed.

A valve, leak down and compression tests performed. Cylinder # 4 had no compression. At that point I take the Pilot to the Honda dealer for TSC# 13-082 who instructed me the protocol was to replace the engine oil and drive it for a month so the oil consumption could be measured. I bounced this off my mechanic who said absolutely not as driving with the misfire code would damage the catalytic converter. The dealer's position was the valve issue had to be repaired before they could run their test.The vehicle was then returned to the mechanic who was to take a more in depth look as to why the valve was not closing and did another compressor test to confirm there was no compression. They take the motor apart and dig deeper to find the piston had hit the valve and bent it. They noted discoloration on the rockers indicating the engine was deprived of oil and heated up, perhaps super hot as something would when not lubricated.

2249,Honda,Pilot,2010,engine problems,Excessive Oil Consumption,Pilot Touring V6,Automatic transmission,"121,500 miles","I had to replace a cam when my vehicle had approximately 85,000 miles on it. The explanation that I received from both the dealership, and Honda, was that is was a fluke. After all, I had strictly followed all recommended oil change intervals via a certified Honda dealership. I have the cam in my possession. The problem I had was that one of the lobes was galled. Upon examination of the mating part, there was no damage on that piece. When the engine was apart, at the dealership, I scraped oil sludge from the valve cover. I could also smell what appeared to be burnt/oxidized oil. I still have this sample in a plastic bag safely put away with my cam. In fact, upon testing the hardness of the bad lobe vs. the good lobe, on the defective cam, via a metallurgist, they both tested the same hardness. It must be noted that I switched over to a full synthetic after the cam was replaced. I also no longer paid attention to the oil minder as I began changing oil every 5,000 miles at this point. The bottom line is that my Pilot has been consuming an excessive amount of oil much earlier than I detected it. I estimate approx. 1 qt. per 1,000 miles. I am extremely disappointed that my dealership did not notify me that my crank case was low when I came in for oil changes. I recently contacted Honda and was given a case number. My dealership has also initiated an oil consumption test for me. However, I already know what the answer will be. At least it will be officially documented this time. Please note that my 1972 Buick Skylark, which was a V8, didn't even consume as much oil as my 2010 Pilot Back then, I changed oil every 2,500 miles and I rarely added oil between changes.

2264,Honda,Pilot,2010,engine problems,Engine Misfire,Pilot EX V6,Automatic transmission,"77,000 miles","WARNING, PLEASE DO NOT PURCHASE ANOTHER HONDA AGAIN UNTIL YOU VERIFY THAT THEY FIX THIS PROBLEM! Apparently Honda knew about an engine misfire (TSB-13-082) caused by their manufactured piston rings affecting cylinder 1 to 4, denied it then allowed it to become a national class action lawsuit. The problem is that the piston rings installed can cause alignment which leak oil into the piston causing spark plugs fouling leading to piston failure and shutdown. Attempting to drive your vehicle with this issue will cause major damage to your engine. Some consumers reported that this started after the warranty ran out and before even reaching 100K miles. Honda has definitely lost its symbol for quality and value. This should have been a safety recall since it leads to an engine failure which could have lead to an accident on the road if traveling at high speed if the engine shuts down. If you encounter this issue and are in the same situation as mine. Please demand them to cover your expenses such as towing to deliver your vehicle to their repair center!Update from Apr 19, 2016: I forgot to mention that my Pilot's engine failed and shut down in the middle of nowhere from this problem.

I refused the service (had to pay for the diagnostic service, rip off) because there was NO WAY I was paying that, when I know spark plugs don't cost that much, & that they're ""bad gas"", was a bunch of crock since the car only had 38,000 miles on it. My husband called the dealer from home to find out exactly what ""Honda"" spark plugs they use. They told us. And asked how many miles on the car. We told them. Their response was, oh you don't need spark plugs for another 100,000 miles on it. My husbands response, ""That's not what you just told my wife earlier today."" Found on this site(THANK YOU WHOEVER POSTED IT) that it's the ""ECO"" engine that does this to foul the plugs #1. #2 (AGAIN, THANK YOU WHOEVER POSTED IT) that HONDA has recently admitted to this problem.

Seems like any time I spend a significant amount of time on the highway (by significant, I mean more than an hour), a whole mess of warning lights come on in my truck, including the check engine light. In each of our last two vacations, we have spent part of a day in a dealership trying to get what ever has been wrong, fixed. The first trip, at a dealership in Vermont while on vacation, the problem was a fouled sparkplug. It was fixed for free, and with half the day ruined, we were on our way (but thankful it was covered, and repaired quickly, and truck washed...yay Burlington VT Honda!!!!!). The second time, again after a trip on the highway, all the lights are on yet again. This time, head to my own dealer in Saratoga, NY and am told my truck is nearly out of oil. We're charged $140 (for an oil change and a hook up to their computer), and we're on our way again. Nothing free, including some sort of reason behind this happening again (we are extremely vigilant with our oil changes)....and no car wash (NEVER buying from here again). Third time, on a 17 hr. trip South, all lights are on yet again. Seven A.M. on a Sunday morning. Pulled off in Fredericksburg VA , and miracles of miracles, there's a Honda dealership, and their service dept. is open!!!! Once again, a fouled sparkplug is to blame. Advised that the shortblock needs to be changed. This dealership said that this problem will continue to happen....lights will continue to come on, till block is changed. Finish our almost ruined vacation, and head to our own dealership when we get home. They won't do a darned thing till lights come on AGAIN. Which, if I kept this truck, would of course be on our next vacation. Not ruining vacation number three by keeping this truck. Trading it in before the kids are upset in the back, and the hubby and I are stressed beyond belief. I LOVE this truck, but am unwilling to deal with the issues....and seriously disgusted with my dealership. Just don't feel safe going anywhere further than 20 miles from the house at this point.Update from Aug 4, 2013: Update....I have an answer (of sorts).  The spark plugs continue to foul due to the ""eco"" feature of the truck..  Bear with me here...don't know much about cars...but, when the eco light comes on in the truck, it's running at it's most fuel efficient...on 4 cylinders, instead of six.  While these two plugs are not firing, they're becoming gunked up with oil.  Eventually, they foul out.  The problem will continue and continue.  Once you replace one plug, the next will become gunked up and will foul, causing all kinds of lights to come on on the dash, and another trip to the dealer.  Will never buy a honda again.				- melissasny,				Gansevoort, NY, US"

We have since checked for complaints on the web, and saw that numerous consumers have the same issue & a law suit settlement. We have contacted american Honda, and now that the recall is out of their timeframe for repairs, (ended 10/2017) they refuse to do anything about it.

We took it back to the service department of the dealer where we brought this at, the service manager was kind of rude, without listening to our stories. He simply blamed both paint chips on us. His explaination was:1. the spot on the passenger side, he CAN NOT see the damage/chip because we touched it up, he didnt speculate the cause. (probably he knew it was caused by poor painting already)2. the spot on the driver side, his explanation was we hit something and cause the paint to clip off .. yes right. The plastic bumper is connected by little metal to the frame. The paint chip is near to the edge, we have a precise touch to hit the bender/bumper without causing any damage but clipping off paint which is about 3/4 inch in diameter. We wish we have that level of skill .. or that level of luck as well.Anyway, the next step is to contact the dealership's management, and also initiate communication with Honda .. hopefully they can provide some level of service to remedy the situation.

It runs very well and I love the size and features it came with. A few years of owning it I received a letter from Honda that stated its supplier used dissimilar metals in the rivets. This will cause the tailgate to rust prematurely so they added a 7 year warranty. Sure enough my tailgate had rust coming through just after reading the TSB. I had it repaired and it looked great. Just after the warranty expired the rust came back FAST. I called Honda and they will do nothing about it now. They ""fixed"" it to last just past the warranty and now I am stuck with a rusty tailgate due to Honda's cheap discount .01 rivets.

I guess if I didnt notice then their half assed job would go without notice. .It was the same exact noise from the begining, the half shaft didnt fix it and then later again, the heat shield didnt fix it. so....

2338,Honda,Pilot,2010,electrical problems,NHTSA: Electrical System: Instrument Cluster/Panel,Pilot,70 miles,,"			This is in reference to the 2009 and 2010 Honda Pilot, all trim levels. The speedometer only has numerical markings for every 20 mph, such as 40, 60, etc. Between these are engraved lines only at increments of every 5 mph. However the engravings are so close in color to the background that they become invisible during many daylight conditions, such as variable shadows, flat lighting, deep shadows, etc. Rather than being able to accurately ascertain your speed by a quick glance at the speedometer, which is a very basic and essential safety obligation (and one which is very easy to comply with, such as done on the Honda CR-V) the 2009-2010 Honda Pilot requires that you divert your attention from the roadway for an extended period of time, as much as 2.5 to 3 seconds, to account for focusing on the speedometer, locating a line, discerning that from the background, etc, similar or longer than the time required to perceive, evaluate, decide and react to an emergency condition on the roadway. In many cases, even when diverting your concentration for an extended time away from the roadway, you are unable to accurately determine your speed. At 60 mph a vehicle will have traveled over 220 feet in 2.5 seconds. This creates a very dangerous condition, certainly equal to or greater than many other causes of distracted driving. I notified Honda of this concern by telephone, but have never received even a return call acknowledging my concern. I believe that they will not take any action unless compelled to do so by your Agency. Thank you very much for your consideration. 							- Wayne, NJ, USA"

From new cars to older cars they are cracking and leaking fluid. This cars was just sold to me in Feb of this year and from Honda dealership. This car contains my kids most of the time it concerns me that Honda is not replacing them with a different product then the same faulty ones. Its not uncommon for the control arm bushings on many Honda/ Acura to expire quickly. It is however a bit dangerous to drive with them if they are starting to wear down or dry rot. They harden when this happens and cause other components on your suspension and sub-frame to fail. The lateral and vertical shaking of your car will cause something to give eventually. It's not something that is putting many children who ride inthem at risk!							- Edmond, OK, USA"

The vehichle had at least accelerated to 20mph to accomplish what had happend.

I suffered hand lacerations as well as forehead with chest bruising from the seat belt and a hand burn from the deployed air bag. I also had a slightly bleeding lip and was released at the scene from the ambulance with a strong suggestion to follow up if necessary.

I am unable to change radio stations, turn on or off, or make any changes other than volume. As of Saturday, I began experiencing no brakes while driving.

Issue was mentioned again to service and we were under the impression the door locks were replaced again (however, they were not - parts were ordered, but not installed). The issue has now moved beyond squealing as the driver door occasionally fails to unlock upon turning off ignition. (the driver door is supposed to unlock automatically, but now fails). We feel this has changed from being simply annoying to a safety issue. If there were an accident the driver door may fail to unlock and the driver could possibly be trapped. However, because we are 3,000 miles past our warranty Honda will not replace door locks again (even though this has been an ongoing issue since day of purchase). They have offered to pay for half however, we were told it would not fix the problem as Honda has not changed the door lock mechanism and fix would most likely be temporary.

There was a class action suit brought in years prior due to many civics and accords having paint fade or oxidation (2003-2007). Thinking that this would get Honda's attention, we decided to purchase a 2011 Honda Pilot, pearl white in color. We thought for sure newer Honda vehicles would not have similar problems. WRONG! The paint problems plaguing Honda continues on to this day with multiple models and colors. We went to the dealership and were told they would only cover 50% of repainting the affected panels. After speaking with the body shop that THEY referred us to, we were told that this is not the first time they have seen this problem with this model, year, and color. They also said that based on what they were seeing the ENTIRE car will eventually peel off and would need an entirely new paint job. Because the answer we got at the dealership was unacceptable we contacted customer service at American Honda. They are TERRIBLE! They don't answer their phone and will not speak to you when you call back. It took me a week to get in contact with the person handling our case only to be told the same thing the dealership told us. Bottom line they know they have terrible paint jobs on their cars and they stiff their customers. They don't give a rip. They stick to their standard 3 year 36,000 mile warranty nonsense and say too bad. I will never buy a Honda vehicle again since they clearly don't know how to paint cars nor do they stand behind their product or take care of their customers.

The vibration has become so bad that I finally gave in and took it to the local dealer today, armed with NHTSA recall and Service Bulletins. There were 4 SB's relating to front end problems and I explained to the service guy that I expected that with 4 SB's, it must be a known issue.

I didn't think the discs were the issue, and the local Firestone had looked at the tires earlier that week and declared them OK.

Took the car to the dealership - they took photos and measurements and submitted our complaint and documentation to American Honda. American Honda did pay to have the roof repainted for us. About a year later, the paint started to peel above the passenger side rear window. Contacted the dealership again - they reached out again to American Honda - no response given back to us.Called the dealership that same summer, they were going to again reach out to American Honda. No word/response given back to us. The paint then began peeling from around all of the passenger and driver side windows. Called the dealership in February of 2021 to again report the problem. Called them back at the end of February. I was told that American Honda was not going to cover the paint peeling problem. I asked what I could do, and the service manager at the dealership suggested that I write a letter to American Honda. I sent American Honda a letter in mid- March. I have not yet received a response from American Honda.After doing some on-line research, I have learned that this has been an issue with this particular paint color on several Honda models.We can tell exactly where the paint is going to peel - it will bubble up - then it will blister open, and then it will peel off. Very frustrating!!Update from Mar 31, 2022: Had my pilot painted at a local body shop.  We spent $2650 to have this done.  Wrote a letter to American Honda regarding the paint and an engine issue in October of 2021.  Received an email from Honda on 11/9/2021 stating that my letter was being assigned to a field services case manager, and was given a case number.  After four months of no contact from Honda, I replied to the email from 11/9 and asked about my letter.  After several emails and phone messages back and forth, I was basically told that they were not aware of any peeling paint issues with the white paint on the Pilots, and that I was well outside of the warranty on the vehicle.I am not impressed with American Honda's customer service, or their willingness to stand behind their vehicles!  Now I am wondering if the length of time that it took for the dealership to get back to me was because Honda was not getting back to them.  I would certainly hope that they would treat their dealerships better!				- Melissa N.,				Newport, PA, US"

2538,Honda,Pilot,2012,body / paint problems,Paint Peeling,Pilot Touring,Automatic transmission,"112,000 miles","2012 Honda Pilot Touring bought used from Hendrick Auto Group on 15-501 in Chapel Hill -- top of the line vehicle in terms of features. It is white. I love the vehicle and expect it to last many years - we own a 2004 Honda Pilot with 280k miles on it, and it is still very dependable. About a month ago, I noticed a small spot of missing paint on the front passenger door (the flat edge at the top of the door at the bottom of the window), which I attempted to fix with touch up paint (bought from another local Honda dealership). That seemed to settle things for a while, but now there is a much larger area of peeling paint directly below this first spot. It appears the paint bubbles up and then falls off. There are also four other smaller spots on the vehicle where this is also happening - one on the edge of the hood; two on the passenger back window trim area; and one on the edge of the windshield. When I took the car to Hendrick Acura for a recent (very expensive) maintenance visit, I asked the Service Rep to assist with the issue. He informed me that I'd have to take the car to a Honda dealership for assistance and ALSO told me that this is a known issue with Acuras and Pilots painted with white paint. That was a bit disappointing because I didn't buy the car from a Honda dealership, I bought it at the Acura dealership. All maintenance done to the vehicle since I've owned it has been done there (at the dealership where I purchased)--so that all the records are in one place. I even make them update the Service Record. Before taking the car to the other local Honda dealership, I called Honda America Corporation to ask for assistance, because I had done an online search and found extensive information about other owners having the same issue. In some cases the dealerships assisted the owner and covered part or all of the repair; in other cases neither the dealerships nor Honda America Corporation would do anything to help the owner. I was given a case number and told I needed information from the Honda dealership on the issue. I took the car in for the Air Bag recall work and I also asked the service rep to take a look at the peeling paint so I could pursue getting help from Honda Corp.He called today to tell me the recall work was done and when I asked about the paint issue, he told me there was no paint warranty extension. I told him I understood this, but that the issue was clearly a manufacturer defect and that there was a lot of information online about this issue and that I was wanting the dealership's assistance to get Honda to fix this issue. When I asked if this was his car, would he find this acceptable, he told me no. So, I will go tomorrow to pick up my car and ask for something in writing from the dealership as to their assessment of the issue. This is NOT from ""pings"" on the car...all areas of peeling paint are completely smooth and the pings on the car (from other cars hitting their car doors into mine) are not peeling...this is clearly a defect. The paint just seems to ""release"" from the primer underneath and fall off.I'd like Honda to fix these issues before they spread and ruin the entire car or require a full car repaint.I will try to work with the dealership or Honda to rectify the situation. If they refuse to take care of the issue, I will contact the local TV stations who do consumer protection stories to see if they will call attention to this issue.Our family owns 3 Honda Pilots, 1 Ridgeline, and 1 Accord. We previously owned another Accord which finally was beyond rescue so we had to let that one go. We are completely committed to the Honda brand, unless they refuse to help with this. It's a very nice car I will have for a long time (as I said, we have a 2004 Pilot as well as a 2015 Pilot) and I'd like Honda or the dealership to make this right. It's a manufacturer defect.For those of you who were successful getting the dealer or Honda Corp to fix your paint issue, how did you approach the issue?				- Rebecca B.,				Chapel Hill, NC, US"

Basically, the plastic molding at the top of the tailgate will pop out and protrude away from the body, leaving a nasty eyesore. From what I can gather from the forums the more auto-savvy guys are citing this as a design flaw due to the placement of the trim joint near the actual lift strut. The excessive pressure from springs lifting the gate puts too much strain on the plastic molding piece, causing it to pop out of place. I have not gotten a response from my dealer yet, but other people who've experienced this problem (base on forum responses) were told that there's nothing that can be done. I'm not being OCD, this is a real eyesore and if you're going to buy a new Honda Pilot you're really rolling the dice on this happening to you.

I had a coil & spark plugs replaced. Within a week same issue. Brought back to mechanic could not find issue. I am constantly putting oil in Honda. Called atamian in Tewksbury where I purchased car. Tried to explain my issue and tried my best to explain about class act that was brought to my attention about 2009-2013 Honda pilot. Service person at atamian stated when your done talking I will tell you what you need to do.Service person stated I would be held responsible for diagnostic cost and spark plug cost. At this point I felt like I would get no where with my issues. I asked to speak to a manager. Waited on hold and then was rudely told manger is busy and was put to voice mail. No one has returned my call. Also my 2012 Honda Pilot has a recall on air bags and fuel system that I learned about on your site. I am very disappointed & I don't know where to get help. Any information would be greatly appreiciated.Thank You,Shanna Cowgill				- Shanna C.,				Pepperell, MA, US"

Car Shutters,Pilot EXL,Automatic transmission,"30,500 miles"," I just purchased a used 2012 Honda Pilot with 30,000 miles on it. The first month was great with no complaints. After one month, I noticed the transmission shifting into overdrive too soon, causing a shuttering noise. It seems to happen simultaneously to the ECO light coming on, which can occur at 25, but most typically occurs at 45 and 55 mph, when on a flat road. I have had it happen once at 25 when I was not accelerating much but I was going up a slight incline. The ""remedy"" occurs when I accelerate, which takes it out of overdrive, also negating the benefit of ECO mileage. I have read online complaint boards and noticed one suggestion that will eliminate the problem, which is to press the ""D3"" button. Of course, this works, because it is bypassing the overdrive option. However, it immediately kicks up the rpms, which also decreases fuel efficiency. When I read the owners manual about the ""D3"" button, it suggests using this when towing (makes sense) or when ""stop and go driving"". Why would they suggest to use it when ""stop and go driving"", when this reduces fuel efficiency? Also, I was getting an average of 20mpg city driving, but I am now only getting about 18mpg city, so it appears to be having an effect on my gas mileage. I am VERY frustrated with this, since I have not purchased a new/used vehicle in years and had researched Pilots for many months before buying one. I had several people rave about them, but I'm am disappointed to already be having problems with mine. I will be taking it to the dealership since it is under warranty, but it does not negate the fact that I will be inconvenienced.

It happens whether the cruise control is on or off, but always happens when I'm cruising along at a constant speed. When the road is very smooth is when it's more noticeable.

Once, about three weeks ago while driving at a constant 50 M.P.H. the transmission shifted from OD to neutral and back into OD again!

I have always loved this body style, and was so excited to find one at a great price. 6 months later, I noticed the paint started coming off between the windshield and the sunroof. I contacted a colleague of mine that teaches collision repair and asked him to give me a quote on how much it would be to fix it. At this time is when I found out that Honda has had issues with their paint, especially the white paint, for quite sometime. As he put it, it is a ""paint defect"", and Honda should have to pay for the repaint, and that the whole roof will need to be repainted. I joined a group on Facebook and learned that I, indeed, am not alone with this, as there are hundreds of us that have this same car, and the paint peeling off in the same spot! Not only this, but 99% of the Pilots were made in Lincoln, Alabama. This is not a coincidence at all. Honda has issues. Honda has been less than kind when contacted. They believe that they shouldn't have to pay for the repaint. I, however, disagree. My Pilot is my first, and last, Honda I will ever own.

I told them I have not contacted my insurance since I can see it is a known defect in the paint for this car model. I had just Googled it and saw. I have had 3 Honda’s prior one Odyssey that was 12 yrs old no problems at all. So she referred me to my local Honda dealer, which is Honda nation in Valencia, Ca and told me they have to inspect it and submit a claim. I went to the dealership, who was hard to get a hold of. Manager saw it 2 days later. He took pictures and said he will submit the claim to Honda but it is strictly on Honda goodwill, and repair will take 10-16 days and they will not provide a rental. While I was at the dealership one of the rep said his own car had the same problem and another customer came in the day before. All cars had the white paint. It was a defect in the paint. The manager called me a couple of days after told me that damage was $1600 my portion will be $400 and no rental car. He was aware of it is a problem with this Honda model and year, that i have no money to pay both $400 and rental for all the days. I called Honda customer service, was transferred mid sentence and then transferred 5 times. 2 reps were kind and tried to help, but last one said while she was helping me, out loud to another rep, oh call dropped, great and hung up on me??? I had explained it all to them and told them my economic circumstances plus also since it is a well known defect, why should we have to pay at all? This will turn out to be expensive for me. One of the reps told me she would resubmit the claim again for appeal to see if they can help me more. But 4 transfers and dropped calls, not cool at all.

July another comes off and I look at the internet and see there is a problem across the country. September a very large piece peels off, about the size of a slice of bread. I go to the closest Honda dealership and they report it to the Honda regional rep. He says tough luck without ever inspecting the car or even seeing a picture. The dealerships are no help because the first thing they ask is, ""Have you been having the car serviced here?"" If you are what they consider a ""Good"" customer they will plead your case to Honda. This is how Honda decides your case if the Pilot is outside the 3 year/36000 warranty. I have gone to 5 different Honda Dealerships and they all tell me there is a problem with 2013 Pilot ""white"" paint. They also tell me that Honda pays for some, pays a percentage on some and refuses to pay on others. If you are unlucky like me, well Honda doesn't care.I have called Honda, and sent twitter messages.

Loved it. And still do. Approximately 9 months after purchase, we noticed a small paint area that was chipping on the passenger side door frame.

A standard problem from what I have seen of other Pilots. It has gotten progressively worse in both areas but specifically the top portion of the vehicle. We again contacted Honda (relentlessly this time) and they clearly have no intention of addressing this issue since we keep getting the run around. We will most likely have to pay out of pocket for an entire car repaint.

First I called to the Tracy Dealer on the phone and they told me that I should bring the car and paint bottle and they will see what they can do for me. I went back to the Honda dealer. I drove all the way from Union City to Tracy Honda dealer in traffic. Took me more than two hours. I talked to the people who sold me the paint. they also tested another bottle and agreed with me that paint color is not correct. it has different color than the car paint, they told me that they will do something about it. But than when the Manager came outside, his name was Bruce. he was very rude. He told me that he can return my money back for the paint but he is not going to fix my car. He can't do anything about it. He told me that they don't make it, was made by Honda Manufacturing. He told me to file a complaint with Honda Manufacturing. I filed a complaint with them.

At that time, I did not have any issues with the paint on my Pilot. Well, a couple weeks ago, a huge amount of paint on my roof was missing all of a sudden. I contacted american Honda as it stated on the recall notice and was told the recall period and my warranty had expired. Nevertheless, I was told a claim was opened on my behalf and that I needed to take the car to my local Honda dealership for a diagnosis. I was then sent to an authorized body shop for an estimate. After having to contact american Honda and the local dealership multiple times, I was told by the body shop that Honda would only cover 60% of the $1700 cost (which was only for the roof to be repainted) and that eventually the rest of the vehicle will also start to peel. I feel cheated and this is truly a lack of customer service on the part of american Honda and proctor Honda.

2681,Honda,Pilot,2013,engine problems,Excessive Oil Consumption,Pilot EX V6,Automatic transmission,"103,091 miles"," Our 2013 Honda Pilot started using a quart of oil every 1000 miles. I change the oil myself and take good care to check it often. We took the car to the dealer to have it checked out on 3/21/18 after a few months of adding oil. The dealer did an oil consumption test, where they change the oil, then we bring it back every 1000 miles to have them check the oil. Their conclusion was normal oil usage, which I do not agree with.Two weeks ago my wife took the Pilot in for an airbag recall and again told them about the oil consumption. They surprisingly said it was covered under warranty (due to NHTSA 10152424 class action law suite) and agreed to fix the problem. The dealer was great and gave us a rental car while they tore down the engine.This week my wife received a call from the service manager that they found excessive metal fragments in the oil and screen. They believed this to be from a crankshaft bearing that was failing. They recommended replacing the engine and that this was not covered by the above warranty, which means I would have to pay for it out of pocket at over $7000.I contacted Honda Corporation and opened a case 09395758. Honda contacted me the next day to get more details. The representative was very nice, but continually told me that this was not something covered, and it felt like they are going to do nothing. I decided to contact an attorney, but it took a while to find one that would take the case (which they feel there is a case here) since there has not been an personal injury. I would rather not have to spend time in court on this, and it may end up costing me more money than it is worth, but the engine problem is not due to my neglect of maintenance, abuse of the vehicle or any fault of mine. This is a manufacturers defect. I do hope Honda is the solid company that I have known in the past. I have (3) Hondas in our family now. If so, this may be the last Honda I buy.Update from Mar 12, 2019: First, I do not know why I need to be updating employees within the same company. This is not acceptable with any company I have worked for in my 40 years of employment.Honda Customer Care got back to us and said that this is not covered, and that the service manager at the dealer said this is a ""recommendation"" not a requirement and that the case is closed. I contacted the service manager with this information (our Pilot's engine is still in pieces as I understand). He stated this was not what was said and to call Customer Care back and have them call him.... (refer to above note on communication)... I did as requested, but got v-mail, so I left a message.This was last week. No calls from anyone at Honda. We contacted the service manager at the dealer. He said he was still waiting for a call. We called back to Honda Customer Care, again, had to leave a message.I have contacted an attorney, but no one is interested in our case because there was no injury, so there will not be any large payout. This is still open, but I do not think it will be in my favor. I am regretting now owning (3) Honda vehicles.				- Jerry S.,				Harmony, US"

We were told it was a very safe way to purchase a preowned car if we didn't want any unexpected problems, because they would be covered. Honda is telling us that burning a quart of oil every thousand miles is not a problem and it is not something they intend to fix under warranty. Well it is a problem to us and we would not have bought this Honda Pilot had we known of this problem. The service tech even suggested that we bring it in every 3,000 miles for an oil change ( more than twice as often as what would be considered normal ) . This seemed rather ridiculous to us since either half its oil capacity would already been changed or it would be running 3 quarts low by then. Obviously not a good suggestion or solution from our point of view. Although, maybe not from theirs, since it would put more money in their pockets.Update from Jan 9, 2018: Since filing our complaint Honda has stepped up and replaced the piston rings on the cylinders that shut down during ECO mode.

Instead, on Monday afternoon, I took my vehicle to an independent mechanic who informed me that the oil is burning and spilling onto the engine and the engine light came on while they were test driving the car. The independent mechanic recommends that the engine and all six spark plugs be replaced. The independent mechanic also told me to researched the issues. And upon further investigation on the NHTSA website, I found that the issues are linked to the NHTSA Campaign Number: 13V382000 (ENGINE). However, my VIN number is not under Recall. Even though there are approximately 258 total complaints for the 2013 Honda Pilots and of those, 59 were engine complaints, I am shocked that Honda has not addressed this issue as of June 2021.

The rep for the dealership informed them that because my oil changes were done at a private mechanic and not at the dealership, no good will would be given and I would be responsible for replacing the engine at my own cost, as well as the wrecked catalytic converter, also a result of the burned oil from the bad pistons.

It can be felt on the steering wheel, seats, dash, etc. At first we thought it occurred at only 62 and 40 mph but the more we drive the vehicle it can be felt at any speed. We had leased a touring Pilot but brought it back after 1400 miles and traded it for a ex-L Pilot hoping the rumble would be less. At first it didn't occur as much, but the more miles it has the worse it gets. The dealership was not very forthcoming with any information on this problem and has no solution or any hope for a solution. The comment was that someone had complained about a vibration but on their test drive they didn't notice it. Any passengers we have immediately notice the rumble and ask what the problem is. On a new car this is embarrassing to say the least. If there were any way possible to get out of this lease without getting upside down on leasing another vehicle I would do it in a minute. This our fourth Pilot and we have had few problems with them. They are very stable on ice and get through the snow very well. Up until 2013 the Pilot seemed to have a very good ride on the highway and we have taken many long trips with our Pilot. Now any trip we take we our preoccupied with this rumble and are constantly asking each other ""can you feel that"". I am very disappointed with this vehicle and if a fix can't be found for this it will be the last Pilot we lease.

There was also a sound that I described as gusts of wind that sounded like it was happening under the driver side of the car (without any shaking of the vehicle). It put me in the mind of an obstruction of air supply, either trying to get into or out of the vehicle. On another blog, an '03 Pilot owner posted a video of the sound and it is exactly what I heard. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I took it to the Honda dealer several times and they could not elicit any such sound or vibration. Either they didn't drive it like they said they did or it simply didn't occur in their presence. I must admit that it happened infrequently at first but became increasingly worse--particularly during this last year. All sorts of lights would appear on the dash and as is common, the ""D"" light flashed almost incessantly. Initially, my husband insisted I must be driving on rough roads but the highway could be smooth as glass and it would still occur. My observance wasn't as detailed as other complaints I've read. For instance, one gentleman said it would happen only after reaching 35-40 mph, or another said that if he kept it in D3 until he reached 60 mph, he could then gear down to just Drive and that would solve the problem for the moment. I never was able to determine, specifically, when the rattling or wind gust sounds would happen and as a matter of fact, it seemed too random to be able to pinpoint.Because I was required to have a vehicle that would safely take a thousand mile trip, I finally took it to a reputable auto service guy about 3 weeks ago who called me and said that he had to install a heat sensor (don't know if that is the same thing as an engine coolant temperature sensor??) before he could diagnose the problem at all but added that he was pretty sure he knew what the problem was. Four days later came the news that the transmission bushings were shot and that a new tranny would need to be ordered at a total cost of $4660.That's my complaint and from reading blogs and other websites, this apparently is very common. With no extended warranty (after all, it is 11 years old), of course I had no recourse but to either submit to the new transmission or just drive it until it bottomed out but that just seemed so cruel. According to tales like mine, Honda was not at all helpful nor forthcoming with any type of assistance--either monetary or informational. It was almost as if they hid their collective heads in the sand.One more thing: your questionnaire doubted the mileage of my vehicle when this started and I'm estimating 130,000 because that was 5 years ago and it is now at about 188,000.				- sad,				Morenci, MI, US"

This was first noticed while on the highway with cruise control set, but has since been observed at multiple speeds with or without cruise control. The vibration starts when backing off the accelerator after reaching a constant speed and continues until the engine loads down due to a hill or further acceleration. This also coincides with the eco light turning off. It does not appear to be related to a shift point, because when the accelerator pedal is depressed, the vibration stops and the engine rpms stay constant. The level of vibration is not as intense as that of riding over rumble-strips, but the frequency is similar. The level of vibration appears worse at higher engine rpms.							- Medway, MA, USA"

He stated he talked to three different automotive mechanics, and it was in their opinion that replacing only the short block of the engine was not a trustworthy fix. The short block repair performed under non-factory conditions, which could lead to contamination of the engine, that would cause serious issues and engine failure in the future.

There was also a low hum. This only happened while in Economode. If you see my attached photo, the bulletin (it's not a recall, as I imagine Honda will not willingly announce to everyone that they should do a $2000 job for a non-life-threathning issue) describes the issue perfectly.Anyway, after getting the truck serviced, the issue is gone. They replaced the propeller shaft and updated the VCM software. Now what happens is that as soon as the transmission feels the smallest need for more power, it disengages Economode and uses all 6 cylinders, thus eliminating the vibration caused by the underpowered 3- or 4-cylinder modes.Hope this helps people - I tell you, I was happy when I learned Honda finally admitted there was a problem. But we have to complain about it to have it fixed - no one will be calling you to say ""hey, remember when you came in about that vibration problem, well we have a fix now...""So, go to Honda.

Contacted Honda Cars of McKinney, where I bought the car (as well a 7 previous Hondas) and they told me to bring it in. They took photos and measured the paint thickness and that they would contact Honda America. They could see that the paint could be peeled off with a fingernail. On the way home I went to two body shops to get their opinions and get an estimate, both were about $1600. Honda Cars of McKinney asked me to take it to the Body Shop they use and get an estimate. All three body shops said it was defective paint job and that the area had not been properly prepared for painting. Honda Cars of McKinney got back with me and said Honda had agreed to split the cost and that my cost would be $350 for the repair. Seems they are taking partial responsibility for this defect but not all of the responsibility. The car is currently in the body shop and having the roof repainted.

Spending $45K on a car, then have that cars paint begin peeling, only to be told that I have to pay for their mistake is not only ludicrous but asinine as well. I am wanting Honda's corporate office to issue out an updated warranty that covers the entire vehicle for paint defects nationwide and pay to fix not just my vehicle, but others as well.							- Colorado Springs, CO, USA"

Two specific scenarios that should be considered but not limit the scope of this concern include the following: 1) the interior of the tailgate does not have an accessible handle for occupants seated in the third row to open the rear hatch and exit the vehicle in a reasonable time frame in the event of a power loss. 2) any door lock failures on the same circuit as the tailgate will cause the rear hatch to become inoperable and not open as intended.							- Indian Trail, NC, USA"

I used the power liftgate and approached the vehicle's rear storage area. The lift support failed to fully lift the tailgate and I struck my head on the tailgate as I leaned in to retrieve something from the rear area. It beeped as if it was obstructed and the tailgate attempted to lift higher but then began to close while continuing to beep. On subsequent attempts to use the power liftgate (within a few minutes), the lift support failed to keep the tailgate up and lifted the tailgate progressively shorter distances with each attempt. The rear tailgate was extremely difficult to open by hand and would not stay elevated without full support. Both lift supports were replaced at home. The driver's side lift support that was removed has no resistance opening or closing by hand. The passenger's side lift support that was removed still has resistance and appears to have been functioning. There was no difficulty with the liftgate prior to this incident.							- Otisville, NY, USA"

2955,Honda,Pilot,2014,engine problems,NHTSA: Engine,Pilot, miles,,"			1. Our 2014 Honda Pilot EXL with only 70,000 miles on it needs a complete engine replacement. The cause was determined to be driving with low oil. The oil life gauge read 50% and we had an oil change only 3 months earlier. No check engine light or low oil light came on, so we had no way of knowing the oil was low unless someone qualified had done a manual inspection which ordinary drivers don't/can't do. In our view the warning lights and/or oil life gauge all failed to warn us of any issue of this nature, therefore letting it get to the point whereby the car needs a complete engine replacement. 2. UNKNOWN. We were lucky that we noticed the smell of fuel/burning close to home so we were thankfully not left stranded on the side of the road. But we were left stranded 500 miles from home while on vacation with no car. It was an absolute nightmare. 3. Yes, we had to tow the vehicle 40 miles to the nearest Honda dealership who confirmed that the engine needs replacing. 4. Yes, the nearest Honda dealership inspected the vehicle. 5. No, and that is the issue. No warnings lamps appeared. The smell of fuel/burning coming from the engine alerted us to the fact that there was an issue and the engine fan carried on running even after the ignition was turned off. Prior to this we had no idea there was an issue with the vehicle. We took care of the vehicle, doing regular oil changes and fluid replacement, etc. FYI - Telling someone that they need to manually check the oil level as you should not rely on the oil life gauge and/or the various warning lights that are designed to detect this problem is both devoid from reality and is akin to telling people that they should manually dip the gas tank to check the gas level as you should not rely on the gas gauge etc. That makes no practical sense and the vast majority of car owners don't do it. 							- Marlton, NJ, USA"

According to the Honda owner's manuel there is a safety feature that prevents the ignition key from being removed unless the vehicle is in park. The vehicle rolled back into a tree causing over $3,000 in property damage. This exact same problem has occurred in the past with the Honda Pilot (2003-2004) and the Honda Odyssey (2003-2004) and the Acura MDX (2003-2006) which were the subject of a recall by Honda. Please see NHTSA action number PE12026. These recalled vehicles as well as our 2014 Honda Pilot are equipped with an automatic transmission. They have a safety interlock system that is supposed to prevent the ignition key from being removed from the ignition unless the transmission is in the park position. When the transmission is not in park, the vehicle may roll unexpectedly increasing the risk of a crash. This is exactly what happened to our 2014 Honda Pilot. I contacted Honda and they could have cared less about this problem even though the same product defect obviously exists again in the new model Honda vehicles.

At 35,400 miles (April 2016) another rim failed for the same reason. At 42,800 miles (July 2016) the third rim failed due to a bad weld joint. Both second and third rims were also replaced by Honda. Honda refused to replace the remaining rim, which at the time was still functioning, but statistically will fail. They did negotiate and agree to sell to us a new rim at cost, and provide the mounting of the tire. All three rim failures were presumably the result of over-heated welding, which penetrated the rim barrel. After a random period of time and stress flexing from the road surface, tiny air channels developed through parts of the welding joint, allowing air to slowly escape. All three failures were noticed via the tire pressure sensors sent to the front panel indicator.							- Mckinleyville, CA, USA"

3032,Honda,Pilot,2014,lights problems,NHTSA: Exterior Lighting,Pilot, miles,,"			1. Our 2014 Honda Pilot EXL with only 70,000 miles on it needs a complete engine replacement. The cause was determined to be driving with low oil. The oil life gauge read 50% and we had an oil change only 3 months earlier. No check engine light or low oil light came on, so we had no way of knowing the oil was low unless someone qualified had done a manual inspection which ordinary drivers don't/can't do. In our view the warning lights and/or oil life gauge all failed to warn us of any issue of this nature, therefore letting it get to the point whereby the car needs a complete engine replacement. 2. UNKNOWN. We were lucky that we noticed the smell of fuel/burning close to home so we were thankfully not left stranded on the side of the road. But we were left stranded 500 miles from home while on vacation with no car. It was an absolute nightmare. 3. Yes, we had to tow the vehicle 40 miles to the nearest Honda dealership who confirmed that the engine needs replacing. 4. Yes, the nearest Honda dealership inspected the vehicle. 5. No, and that is the issue. No warnings lamps appeared. The smell of fuel/burning coming from the engine alerted us to the fact that there was an issue and the engine fan carried on running even after the ignition was turned off. Prior to this we had no idea there was an issue with the vehicle. We took care of the vehicle, doing regular oil changes and fluid replacement, etc. FYI - Telling someone that they need to manually check the oil level as you should not rely on the oil life gauge and/or the various warning lights that are designed to detect this problem is both devoid from reality and is akin to telling people that they should manually dip the gas tank to check the gas level as you should not rely on the gas gauge etc. That makes no practical sense and the vast majority of car owners don't do it. 							- Marlton, NJ, USA"

(more on this later) I walked outside near the exhaust pipes and heard a definite misfire sound (like a motorboat). When continuing to drive and accelerating from stop I could feel a lack of power or a stumbling from the engine. I brought the car into the dealership the next morning and was informed that the VTM-4 light was a result of the misfire and has to do with engine management. I left the car with them and they called me later to inform me that the misfire was coming from cylinder 1 and they would need to replace the piston rings on cylinders 1-3 at a cost of $3500!I complained to my service writer about how outrageous this was on a 2015 Pilot that only has 99,0000 miles, which was always serviced at the dealer including oil changes, on it and that my last Pilot (2006) had well over 100,000 miles on it when I sold it to a friend, who drove it for several years without issue. This was a significant factor in purchasing another Honda Pilot. I agreed to the repairs reluctantly because this is my wife's car and she can't do without it. This didn't set well with me so I did some research online and found out that Honda was sued over this issue and they issued an extended warranty (8yr unlimited miles) on the vehicles that were effected. Of course my vehicle with the same issue fell outside of the parameters so I am not covered!I contacted Honda Customer Care and complained about how I have the exact same issue with my vehicle and I want it covered also.The rep I talked to took down all the information and sent it up to the Case Manager who I should hear from within a week.I wonder if anyone on this website has had a similar issue and was able to get Honda to pay for the repair?Thank YouUpdate from Jun 7, 2022: Well after multiple correspondents with Honda Care, Honda agreed to help me with the cost of repairs and issued me a check for 1/2 the amount of the repair, $1700 approx.So even though I am not happy with the reliability / longevity of the engine, I believe to be a design flaw with their variable cylinder management system, I believe Honda treated me fairly. I won't buy another Honda with this VCM system because the cylinders effected with ring problems are the very same cylinders that they control with the VCM for better mileage.

The tech messed up and damage the head of the engine because the timing was off. When they took it apart to fix, they said it appeared to have fouled plugs too, like it was burning oil. When they put it back together it was misfiring really badly. They couldn't figure out why. They decide to replace the engine block. As they were installing the replacement block, they found out it was cracked. So, they ordered another one. They installed that one and it seem it was working. I noticed after getting the car back that the gas mileage was absolutely horrible compared to the original engine. I mentioned it to the dealer and they said it probably just needed a little break-in. However, this was not a new engine block. It was from some other vehicle with about 85K miles on it. I ended up taking it to a different garage, since I couldn't really trust them anymore. They said the engine doesn't have any faults and they don't know why the gas mileage is like that either. After doing a few oil changes since I've had this not-so-new engine installed, it seems to go through oil really fast. I inspected the vehicle several times and during every oil change and I see no signs of a leak anywhere. I have to add oil several time between oil changes now. This is not right. I did some research and it appears this is an issue with a service bulletin 11-033 but it is for 2013s and older. My vehicle seems to be having the same issue.

Have followed all lemon law guidance from state of Georgia and Honda continues to produce lies and false statements to cover up a problem which has even been written about by edmunds.com. Corporate rep met me at dealership to evaluate problem. He acknowledge problems during a test drive; stated that some cars just don't make it off the assembly line perfect, and that my vehicle is one of those vehicles. Honda corporate also states that the local dealership is in concurrence with their assessment, and I know for a fact that they are not based on discussions with them and with their service technicians who have worked on my vehicle. Honda should be ashamed of how they are ignoring an operating problem with this vehicle; expanding acceptable tolerance limits in order to call this vehicle normal and safe.							- Roswell, GA, USA"

3098,Honda,Pilot,2015,engine problems,NHTSA: Engine And Engine Cooling,Pilot 6-cyl,"84,000 miles",,"			I purchased a new top of the line Honda Pilot ex-L back in 2005. My wife drove it for nine years and took impeccable care of it. I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss.

3116,Honda,Pilot,2015,body / paint problems,Paint Peeling Off,Pilot Touring,Automatic transmission,"50,000 miles"," click to see larger imagesI bought this car in July 2018 and it was a perfect car with 48,000 miles. It was a lease car for 50,000 miles and they turned it in with 48,000. It is top of the line Pilot Touring. In October I noticed the paint was peeling off in sheets down to bare metal above the windshield on the roof, so I took it to the dealer. First of all, that is NOT normal paint behavior, it will chip, you can sand it off, but properly applied paint does not peel off down to the metal. Well, the dealer had to send this up to corporate and they agreed to share the cost to re-paint the entire roof at 3 to 1 cost. I would pay a 1/4 and they would take care of 3/4, basically saying they were responsible, but it was just out of warranty. So I had it re-painted at my cost of $263.00. When I agreed to pay my share and now having Honda's agreement that they were at fault, I asked the service manager about what if this happens elsewhere on the car, what should I do? He assured me that this was in my file and that they would follow the same process. Now it is May 2019 and guess what?! Yep, now it is happening again on the front of the hood. Same thing, it's peeling off in sheets and bubbling up around it, so more is to come, so back I go to the dealer. This time my original service manager is no longer there, but I get the manager that was familiar with my issue before because I met him at the time, so he sends it up. The first response from Honda was that they would do the same share of the expense so he sent it back saying that it should be all covered by Honda. Honda came back with an extension of paint warranty for 2015 White Pilots out to 2022 or 7 years. He was going to give them a chance to send the new recall info out before scheduling a time to get it repaired. Today June 25, he finally gets back to me and says that Honda ONLY extended the warranty for Roofs and not the hood of the vehicle and that they were now willing to only cover half of the cost. I am royally pissed about this! And this makes no sense whatsoever! Well, I guess it does, so Honda has a batch of bad white paint jobs on white Honda Pilots in 2015, and they KNOW IT, but they won't cover anything, but the roof. Initially he said it was for the entire car, but now it is just for the roof and not the hood, but ok we'll pay for half. I don't know whether I should go back and say, no you need to cover all of it as it is the same as what happened on the roof or should I say, well, I should at the very least be offered the first deal you offered of 3/4 to 1/4 cost split, meaning I pay 1/4 of the cost and actually if they do that it should cost me nothing since I already have paid 1/4 of the cost of the roof which the warranty has now been extended to 7 years for the roof? I know these are run-on sentences, but I am so frustrated. This is our 4th Honda and we still have our 2006 Ridgeline and the paint has never peeled on any car. We have had and still do have several older model Mercedes and have never had any issues with paint. Maybe our last Honda if Honda doesn't work this out!				- foster.pw,				Gainesville, US"

I drove many different cars during past 15 years but this is the one car where I feel so unsafe & unrelable while driving. Talked to technical people at Honda service station. Did a ride with them and able to replicate same issue. As per Honda service station its ABS system make that sound and prevent Pilot to stop. They said that the Honda Pilot is heavy car, so thats why it make that much sound and wont stop easy. This is not a safety measure. They don't have any resolution for this issue. I spend a big amount of money for me and my family safety and this seems like much worse then any old cars. I don't know who do I complaint and get my money back.							- Beaverton, OR, USA"

The water was pushed up over the top of the vehicle in a solid sheet, that was heavy enough to completely obscure vision for at least 3 seconds. This happened once while accelerating onto this toll road and again a mile or so further down the road when I was traveling at freeway speed. Visibility was completely lost while traveling in a very light rain in non flood conditions at entry ramp speeds and then again when we were cruising at about 65 mph, down the toll road. The rain was so light that the wipers were on delay and did not activate during the incident. This is obviously a very serious design flaw for this vehicle. I've noticed in the ads for the 2016 model, that the configuration was changed. I've also seen the notice in the paper that Honda received a 70 million dollar fine for lying about how many people that have been injured and killed in their vehicles. I'm positive this is one of the reasons why. The brakes don't seem to be very reliable, either, getting firmer in cooler weather and grabbing and getting mushy around 70 degrees. They also pump up when backing up.							- Pasadena, TX, USA"

This condition was confirmed by a Honda dealer toward the end of the same month. The failed bushing is a defective design that has existed on Pilot vehicles since at least 2009 and persisted in successive models. The fluid-filled elastomeric bushing failure is manifested by loss of fluid which leaves a black streak on the underside of the control arm necessitating an unscheduled maintenance action. Left undetected, the failure would lead to a loss of structural integrity and conceivably a loss of control under consistent hot and dry environmental conditions where polymer degradation is accelerated.The attached files depict the failed bushing as well as a serviceable bushing from the same vehicle.							- Phoenix, AZ, USA"

I believe manufacturers should be required to continue to provide a maintenance schedule for their vehicles. If I were to rely solely on the maintenance minder, I fear that necessary maintenance would not be performed. And no, I do not use a dealership to perform my maintenance - I use an independent shop. This lack of a maintenance schedule increases the risk for improper maintenance and poses a potential safety hazard.							- Silver Spring, MD, USA"

My wife drove it for nine years and took impeccable care of it. I started driving it a year ago when we leased a 2013 CR-V for her. A couple of weeks ago, I was making the three mile journey to work when I noticed that my heat was no longer working. After work, the car had some transmission slip when leaving the parking lot. I stopped home briefly to make arrangements to take it to the local Honda dealer. We always had it serviced there ( mostly oil changes, a set of brake pads, etc. As it only had 84,000 mi. On it). On the way to the dealer, who was five miles away, the transmission was slipping more and more. Then, the vehicle started to massively overheat. I'm glad I was not on a busy highway or in heavy traffic. Long story short, after the technician evaluated it, I had a catastrophic failure due to the transmission fluid mixing with the antifreeze. I needed a head gasket for the motor due to the heat, a new radiator that had an internal design failure, and the transmission needed to be replaced as well. A vehicle does not require a mixture of antifreeze and transmission fluid anywhere, nor at any time in the history of automobiles. The repair would have cost nearly what the value of the car was. I called Honda motor Corp. And was offered no help. The value of the car was roughly $10,000. I chose not to proceed with the repair, as I felt it would have been a foolish decision. After my family has owned a half-dozen Honda vehicles, we will never buy another one. I feel that Honda owes me the value of the car due to their overly engineered radiator. We suggested that they put the value of the Pilot against the lease balance on the CRV, they denied that suggestion. The moment the heat went out, I had no idea that my car was already a total loss.

I asked the service rep could the fuel injection problem that started the bucking have contributed to the transmission problem? He said no-way. I asked my auto repair shop, and their transmission expert got on the phone with me immediately and said this absolutely was the problem.

I had an extended warranty, I reported the issue multiple times, and they refused to acknowledge ownership of the problem - all because the notes that the service techs were inputting conveniently left out the problems I was reporting on almost every occasion! Lesson learned, always ask for paper copies of every note a dealership enters into their system on your vehicle! I am sorely disappointed in Honda.And to and insult to injury, Honda never reported, nor conducted the fix for service bulletin 17-014 (update software/flush transmission).

She told me that the technician would drive the vehicle with a computer hooked to it to record what was happening. They confirmed the problem and fixed the issue under warranty. The solution was TSB 17-014 (software update and transmission flush). Total time at the dealership was about four hours. The vehicle drove much better after the fix.

I drove it to the dealer on 8/31/19 (50000 Miles) and filmed the tac jerking back and forth with my phone and then panned to the fact that I was driving by the dealership.

The transmission fluid deteriorates quicker than expected when it is exposed to intermittent high heat loads under specific driving conditions.Check if the software has been updated.

As soon as the vehicle reaches 80,000 miles Honda will no longer cover the so-called “repair” which is to flush the burnt transmission oil multiple times. This costs almost $400. If you have this problem please report it to NHTSA at 1(888)327-4236.Honda knows they have a defective transmission and, instead of fixing it, they are passing the transmission flush cost on to the buyers.

It started not too long after the 30k service. I was going up a freeway on ramp and immediately noticed the car struggling/jerking a bit until I got up to speed. A huge telltale sign of it was watching the RPM needle jumping as the RPMs were going up. It is supposed to be a linear increase as the RPMs go up. After I let off the gas (speed of traffic already) the problem went away. It happened once in a while after that but I never was able to recreate it on demand. It always happened at random times while accelerating. I took it into the dealer at my 35k service and mentioned it to my service advisor. He said he is familiar with what I described and will have the tech check it.Apparently, a few days prior to my appointment, the service advisor had a 2017 Pilot that had the issues I described for a short amount of time before experiencing transmission failure due to a sensor issueAfter the service was done, my advisor informed me the tech was unable to recreate the problem I described so nothing was done. My advisor told me to continue to drive the vehicle until the problem persists, then bring it back. He said any warranty repairs that the transmission needed has to be allowed by corporate first. If the tech doesn't see the problem, corporate would not allow the warranty repair. My advisor told me to wait it out instead of fixing it out of pocket.A few months have passed and it seems the problem is getting worse (40k miles). I haven't been able to get it to happen on demand still, but notice it occurs much more often when the vehicle is going up an incline or after it has been driven for a while. The most recent one was going up a street with a gradual incline (for those of us who are familiar San Francisco, going up Fulton street from Ocean Beach to 25th Ave). It jerked/stuttered much more violently while climbing the hill and accelerating from a complete stop. The problem got a little better after a short meal break before disappearing again the following day. I can't seem to get it to happen consistently enough in order to get a video of it. Now I am just driving it until it happens on demand but hoping I wont get stranded from sudden transmission failure.A friend described the feeling as though the vehicle was struggling to either switch gears or produce enough power for the appropriate gear. It is like you skipping a gear when driving manual, instead of going from second to third, you go straight to fourth/fifth. The problem seems to stop when the you force the transmission to downshift by pressing the gas harder, but once you let off it feels like it struggles for a moment to find the right gear to be in.Waiting for another week to see if it gets worse before making an appointment again. I don't want to waste my time leaving my vehicle to them in hopes they see the problem.				- Kin L.,				San Gabriel, CA, US"

I thought he was joking because I never felt it and I am the one who drives the car most of the time while he only drives maybe once or twice a week. He couldn't recreate the problem so we blamed on the gas that he put last time from arco (I usually use Shell or Mobil). Some time went by and my car was doing fine until one morning the jerking occurred on my way to drop off my kids. The jerking was significantly felt. There were several times. I told my husband about it and it happened that the car was running on arco gas again at the time. So, we decided not to use arco gas on this car anymore. Unfortunately, it was not because of arco's gas (my apologies to arco). My Pilot started jerking on all kinds of gas, Costco, Shell, etc. The most recent event was yesterday 8/26/2018. Our family was driving on a local road and when the car accelerated to about 30-40MPH, it jerked and everyone felt it. Then the jerking repeated all the way to our destination. I got really worried because the car was running on Shell gas! I immediately researched 2016 Honda Pilot problems using my phone and guess what? I am not alone!!! I cannot believe a Honda would have a transmission problem. I have scheduled an appointment with a local Honda dealer tomorrow.

Obviously, at the end of the day, they told me there is nothing wrong with the car! They said they've  checked transmission oil and it was all fine. They've run the computer check and nothing showed up. So they wouldn't even do the SERVICE BULLETIN 17-014 like other owner mentioned! My choices are, leave the car at the dealership until they can recreate the problem, which nobody knows when? Or start looking for a new car. BTW, honda does not provide loaner unless it is a recall. So how can they expect their customers do without their vehicle? The advisor told me my car still has a lot of time before the warranty runs out, just bring it back when the problem gets worse.

However, further searching On the Piloteers Website, I found that the newest recommendation was to change the AT fluid every 30K, not 60K miles! The Honda AT fluid is $50/ quart and needs 4 quarts. I also found the the rear differential fluid had the same interval. The AT also needs two new special drain and level plugs at $25 a piece. This all costs about $800 at the dealer every 30K miles! I decided to follow the special procedures and do it myself. Both the AT and diff fluids were unexpectedly dark, so they did needed to be changed. These are not easy to change, so I guess the dealer can justify the charges (or $5000 for a new transmission if not changed).

I was charged $77 for a PGM-FI update because my warranty had ran out. I understand a warranty covers mechanical issues that occur due to wear and tear over time. But having a customer pay for a system patch/update that has nothing to do with wear and tear is unfair, wrong and poor customer service by Honda. An update/patch is designed to solve an inherently flawed system. Which means that Honda knew that their customers would suffer a computer system issue, hence why Honda developed the patch. So why should the customer pay for an issue that Honda already knew existed even before the purchase of the vehicle? Again this is unfair, wrong and poor customer service by Honda. Imagine if Windows, Samsung or Apple customers had to pay for a system updates because their warranty had expired every time a patch was released. There would be a public outcry and rightfully so. Charging loyal customers for a resolution to a problem that is not the customer's creation or fault would be considered extortion and day light robbery. Honda needs to understand that in addition to selling hardware products they are also selling the software embedded in their products. As producers/developers of software they should make the updates/patches for their products freely available like every reasonably minded software organization. Honda customers should not pay for the software patch because Honda developed a flawed computer system embedded in the engine of their vehicle. Instead Honda should work with its dealers to make every system update freely available to its customers. This is the fair, right and excellent customer service I have come to expect and should continue to expect from Honda.				- Joedon A.,				Bryant, US"

3285,Honda,Pilot,2016,engine problems,Auto Idle Stop Does Not Work,Pilot Elite 3.5L 280 Hp V6,Automatic transmission,"16,000 miles","Approximately 4 months ago, when the vehicle was in idle-stop mode and would attempt to start again, the radio would cut out. Recently, on a couple of occasions, the vehicle would not start automatically and would require a complete manual start (put in park, press the brake and push the start button). I took it to the dealership a week ago to have it checked out. I was told it was a ""software"" adjustment that was needed to correct the problem. Everything was fine for a couple of days and then the same problems started to reoccur (radio cutting out and occasional lack of restarting from the idle-stop mode). I will be taking the vehicle back a second time for the same problem.Update from May 14, 2018: Problem with Idle stop function is getting worse.  More frequent stalling at stops.Update from May 14, 2019: After several trips to the dealer, it was determined that the battery was causing the idle-stop to fail to start the vehicle when the engine had been turned off.  A new battery has fixed the problem back in 2017. It is now 2 years later and the problem is starting to re-occur.  I assume it is again a battery problem. Update from Jun 30, 2019: My update is at 33,000 miles.  I am not experiencing the original problem of the vehicle shutting off at auto idle stop, but I am starting to get ""pauses"" when the vehicle tries to start back up.  It is if it is close to stalling out, but does not.  Once again, I assume the problem will get worse and I will need to replace the battery for a 2nd time.  This seems to be a very unreliable system based on the complaints I have read.  The dealerships have a tendency to ignore this problem or blame it on a variety of problems.  In fact, it would appear to me that when the battery starts to degrade, the auto idle stop function starts to experience problems.  The only solution I see is to replace the battery as soon as there is any sign of the problem.  				- Kenneth S.,				Fort Lauderdale, FL, US"
3286,Honda,Pilot,2016,engine problems,Auto Idle Stop Does Not Work,Pilot Touring V6,Automatic transmission,"15,328 miles"," I bought a 2016 Honda Pilot Touring in July 2016. I drove it for 4,000 miles unaware of the auto/idle stop system because all of a sudden it started working and I thought something was wrong with the car. It worked for a little while and then stopped working. I took it in for service and they explained what it was. Sometimes I get a message the the auto start stop idle is unavailable but sometimes I don't. Between that service is and my recent 15,000 mile service it has worked very little. I just had it in for service and was told that it does not work when in sport mode or when the AC fan is on low. Laughing because I live in Florida and it is rarely on low. Anyhow, obviously they did not even test drive the car because they would see it wasn't working. They did not get an error code so I guess they have become so dependent on that that they cannot think for themselves. I will deal with that issue with service.I was considering upgrading to a 2017 Elite and had checked what was new for the 2018 Pilot before I even considered upgrading. Well, I learned that the AUTO IDLE START STOP will be a different system in the 2018s. That tells me Honda knows their current system is crap. Too bad that the changes to the 2018 are such that I will not buy one, specifically shortening the wheel base and removing the 3rd row. And the fact that the 2017 has the same crap system will keep me from upgrading to a 2107 Elite. Also, how the dealership has deal with my issue means I will not be buying anything from them either.So, I am just like the rest of the others here that has paid a lot of money for a car with a system that does not work. I hate it anyway and I'm not sure why automakers are pushing these systems. Maybe the federal government is the problem meddling in automakers businesses to get better mileage.

3290,Honda,Pilot,2016,engine problems,Auto Idle Stop Does Not Work,Pilot Touring 3.5L V6,Automatic transmission,333 miles,"click to see larger imagesWell, I decided to purchase a new 2016 Honda Touring Pilot from a local dealer. I have been reading an awful lot of complaints on this new vehicle from Piloteers.org. I have to say that I am not experiencing all the same complaints, however, at this point, only one. My Auto Idle Stop feature does not work or it works intermittently. Jury is still out on that issue. I received the SUV with 12 miles on her. I started to realize soon after that my Auto Stop Idle was not working. It did work a few times, etc... This was probably around 250 miles. I took Suv to dealer at 333 miles on her, where they sat me down and explained that a lot of certain conditions need to be met for it to work. I replied,that I read the manual and CD. I met all those requirements. ""It still does not work."" Actually, I just looked at what the service tech wrote in her comments and don't agree at all. She wrote ""C/S Stop Idle is Inop. Please advise. Customer spoke with Scott-will leave his last name omitted and went over stop Idle operation. No corrective action to be made. Working as described."" How can she say, it is working as described? Scott indicated that he didn't know why it isn't working. He went on to tell me that unless the icon flashes and throws a code, they can't do anything. I understand that logic, however, it isn't working and it isn't throwing any codes to the computer. What do I have to do to get this to work? It should work every time I have the system on and ready. Seat belt on, defroster off, all engine temps normal because of driving the SUV, system on and ready, no flashing icon. What do they want, screaming kids in the back seat bouncing all around to get this system to work? Bottom line is that it does not work and I somewhat felt blown off at my dealer. I realize that the SUV is brand new. I don't know what to do. I paid over 46k and feel all advertised systems should work 100% of the time. Thank you.Update from Nov 7, 2015: This is an update to my original issue with the Auto Idle Stop. After I wrote the complaint the other morning, you will never guess what happen to work the next day? Yup the Auto Idle Stop. I had exactly 415 miles on vehicle. The only thing I did that was different was a few days prior I went in to the settings on my 8"" screen. Vehicle-meter, turn on and off the Auto Idle Stop. I turned it on and off a few times, so you could see it on the MID. Has nothing to do with the manual button you press on the center shifter. I leave that on all the time. Besides it defaults to on every time the car is started. It was raining out and for a second I thought that maybe, I am experiencing a condensation issue with the system. I don't know... I plan on monitoring this. I realize that certain conditions need to be met for it to operate. I meet all the conditions everyday I drive the vehicle. You turn it on, it should operate, you shut off, it doesn't. I think it is possibly a software related problem. I recently was made aware from these great web sites that a recall is under way for a ""software update odometer issue"" on the Pilot. I wonder if this is somehow related as well? Jury is out on that one too. Will keep the site posted.. All I know now is that it works..................... If anyone else is experiencing these issues please report it here and on Piloteers.org. Honda sure as hell isn't going to call us and say. Hey we screwed up on the Pilot. They will only do this if they have too. Thank you...Update from Nov 11, 2015: Stopped working again at 525 miles, etc...				- gmarkxs63,				Erie, PA, US"

Car was in the middle of a busy underpass, driver luckily not rear-ended in the dead car. Driver was thereafter able to follow on-screen instructions for restarting vehicle and taken to Honda for service. The best the Honda dealership service department appears to be able to do in diagnosing the problem is to suggest battery recharge or replacement, which has not been an observed issue in the car and is apparently a common suggestion from dealerships. Battery was replaced yet upon return from dealership the idol start no longer works at all.  This is an apparently bigger issue than Honda has been willing to admit. It's extremely dangerous to have a vehicle (only 12k miles) that will stall and not respond to restarting, while in middle of busy roads!

Basically, the car dies - it loses all power and every warning light you can imagine starts to go off. If you give it gas, the car starts to shake like it has a major transmission problem. This has happened twice on the highway and once in busy traffic - luckily, we have been able to get to the side of the road. The first time this happened, we called for a tow but we were able to ""reboot"" the car by starting and stopping it over and over again. Since then, we have used that trick to get the car working again but it is very scary and dangerous to have your car just stop working in the middle highway. I have seen a few similar complaints on this forum but it's unclear whether anyone has gotten help from Honda to get this issue fixed. It seems like a software problem of some kind but it's unclear what triggers it because it has happened in three different circumstances.				- Scott W.,				Chicago, IL, US"
3296,Honda,Pilot,2016,engine problems,Check Engine Light On,Pilot Touring AWD 3.5L V6,Automatic transmission,"48,000 miles"," The engine emissions and AWD warnings started illuminating intermittently. A scan of the DTC codes produced 0172 (bank 1 fuel too rich) and U0401 (fuel system abnormalities A/T). The codes went away for a couple months, then returned and stayed on. Internet searches found that the fuel injectors were potentially clogged. This engine uses direct injection instead of intake injection, so the injectors spray fuel directly in the cylinder next to the spark plug. This requires very high pressure and the tip of the injector is directly exposed to the burning fuel. Additionally, the intake valves are not washed by incoming fuel so they can get dirtier. I decided to increase the cylinder temperature by switching from premium to lower octane fuel. Plus, I added Techron injector cleaner every fill up. After four complete tanks of this mixture, the warning lights went off and finally stayed off—For 400 miles so far. We were able to pass the yearly emissions test. I will use mid or low obtain fuel and occasionally add injector cleaner and see if that works. If not, I will change out the six injectors. Considering the mileage, I’m surprised at these potentially expensive problems.				- webs1000,				Atlanta, US"

My warranty expired in Sept 2019 and I only have 31000 miles on my Honda Pilot; and on a recent trip from Oklahoma to Alabama, the emission control light came on again! Of course the owner's manual is not much help with this type of warning light and so I went to the internet to do research. It appears this problem exists on many 2016 Honda Pilots but Honda has never done a recall. Now I'm angry that it could be a costly replacement of the fuel injectors and this has been a common problem with this new fuel injection engine and now my 3 year or 30,000 mile so-called warranty has expired!

The next morning (day two), I meet the technician and I show him the sound directly. The technician agrees the sound is internal to the engine.A TSB has been issued to address this very noise; it entails adding a shim to a timing belt pulley. The shim adds clearance between the timing belt and the timing belt housing/cover. Service advisor contacts American Honda who administers the extended warranty.Service advisor informs me American Honda will not offer to resolve the issue. It is 'noise only' and no functional loss. If I wanted the TSB fix applied, I would pay for the parts and labor out of pocket.

3304,Honda,Pilot,2016,engine problems,Engine Failure,Pilot Elite,Automatic transmission,"80,097 miles"," We purchased our 2106 Honda Pilot Elite new in 2016 and the 100,000-mile warranty. My wife was in a car accident after three months (not her fault, and nobody was injured), and the car was totaled, so we had to purchase a new vehicle. The interest rate went up from 1.99 to 2.99. Fast forward to February 2022; after paying $800 per month for over five years, we paid it off and received the title! One month later, I was driving the car and heard a rattling noise after accelerating at a stop light. Speaking of stop lights, we had to turn off the auto-shutoff because the car stalled 50% of the time when we had it on. Back to the rattling noise, I took it to Honda and they determined the engine failed and we need a new one. Our engine went out at only 80,000 miles a month after receiving the title for the car. 80,000 miles! It's ok; at least we have the 100k mile warranty:). Our service technician informed us we do NOT have the 100k warranty on the new car. I understand that after the vehicle is totaled, the new purchase is treated as a new car purchase, but we do not remember declining the warranty; pretty sure our sales rep dropped the ball on that one. To Honda's defense, I should have checked our records to ensure we had the warranty, but I didn't.The next thing we did was file a claim with Honda Corporate; 80,000 miles seems very low for engine failure, so we were hoping Honda would stand behind their product and offer a goodwill credit towards the engine repair. Full credit would have been great, but we would have been happy with partial credit. My wife spent hours tracking down every receipt for services on the car. We provided every receipt requested and hand-delivered them to the service manager at Honda Schaumburg. After multiple unreturned phone calls and emails, we finally discovered our claim was denied.I experienced other issues with the Pilot; getting stalled at stop lights due to the auto engine stop and the start was by far the worst. I took it to Honda, and they repaired the start button, but it did not fix the issue. The next time they said my battery was bad, they were wrong because I purchased a new battery a few months prior. The auto tailgate open and close worked about 60% of the time, and we did not open the sunroof by the driver and passenger seats because it did not always close. When we filed our claim, we informed Honda about all of the issues above.The Pilot was the 3rd and last Honda I will ever purchase.

When I got the Pilot back I parked it in my garage. I did an errand and parked it back in my garage. Later, I discovered two oil spots, one large and one small in my garage. I called San Tan Honda and they scheduled an appointment the very next day. They said it is residual oil that landed on the sub frame during the oil change and that the oil filter was intact. The service adviser told me the mechanic cleaned the sub frame of the residual oil. I brought the pilot back home, parked it in my driveway so I could clean the oil spots in my garage. When I moved the pilot back in the garage, I discovered oil spots in my driveway (post cleaning by the mechanic). I called that in to San Tan Honda and they were kind enough to offer to send a cleaning unit to clean my driveway....I told them I already clean the oil stain. Kudos to San Tan Honda (Auto Nation Honda Chandler) for going over and beyond in customer service.Here's the problem, the engineers placed the oil filter right above the right front sub frame of the 2016 Pilot. There's no room to put a the drip pan to catch the oil that leads into the barrel. If the oil filter tilts a little upon removal or falls over you can have up to a 1/2 cup of oil spill unto the sub frame. No amount of cleaning short of steam cleaning the sub frame will removed the spilled oil. I hand only one oil changed and already my sub frame on the right front is greased up due to the spilled oil.There's four solutions:l) after an oil changed, parked your 2016 Honda on the street for a month or buy a large drip pan for your garage.2) Have Honda engineers redesigned the engine so there's nothing directly under the oil filter so that the mechanic can placed the drip pan directly under the filter to catch the old filter and any residual oil.3) Come up with a policy/procedures for the Honda mechanics to follow to redirect the residual oil into the drip pan....such as: have a piece of sheet metal (12"" by 18"") with a center crease placed under the oil filter that is about to be removed, with the lower end of the sheet metal placed above the drip pan. That way the oil filter and any residual oil would still drip into the drip pan and not the the sub frame. 4) Do your oil change yourself and put more care about channeling the residual oil into a drip pan then the mechanic....keeping the sub frame from getting all greased up.Let me make a note that Auto Nation Honda Chandler was very accommodating and this design flaw is by no way reflect on their ability to remedy the situation.				- Thomas D.,				Chandler, AZ, US"

While stopped at a local pharmacy on 10/31/2020 the check engine light (CEL) came on and showed that there was a problem with the Pilots ""emissions"" system and the AWD system. Scheduled an appointment with the dealership that sold us the Pilot on 11/04/2020 for the CEL (CEL automatically cleared when we restarted the Pilot on 11/01/2020). While at the dealership they were able to bring up the stored CEL codes and told us that it was a known fuel injector problem (TSB# 18-025) and that we should get it replace. However, due to our Pilot being out of the 3y/36000 mile warranty it would cost us $1000. We could not afford it and could not get the issue fixed. This was our only vehicle and Honda does not care what the problem is since it is out of warranty.				- Ji C.,				Morgantown, WV, US"

The codes first produced an emission system problem. I asked repeatedly if this could be a fuel line, pump, filter issue, and I was laughed at. The problem continued for the next 70,000 miles. I continued to report the problem, but was so upset with the customer service at the dealership, I started going to a local auto repair shop. Eventually, the codes turned into a fuel/air mix problem. The fuel injectors had crapped out, and a ""bucking"" started occurring when I would accelerate (usually noticeable around 1200-1800 RPMs). Had the fuel injectors and spark plugs replaced with Honda OEM replacements kits. The check engine light didn't come on anymore, but now the bucking continued and was seemingly getting worse. Took it back to the dealership to learn that the transmission needs to be replaced. WTF??? I asked the service rep could the fuel injection problem that started the bucking have contributed to the transmission problem? He said no-way. I asked my auto repair shop, and their transmission expert got on the phone with me immediately and said this absolutely was the problem. He also went on to say how Honda is notorious for covering up faults by classifying problems in many different silos, rather than owning up to related problematic issues that cause further damage to the vehicle. I used to have a 2004 Pilot, and a 2008 Odyssey. To keep things transparent, I even called Honda corporate, was passed around to several different reps, none of which actually did anything other than placate. I had an extended warranty, I reported the issue multiple times, and they refused to acknowledge ownership of the problem - all because the notes that the service techs were inputting conveniently left out the problems I was reporting on almost every occasion! Lesson learned, always ask for paper copies of every note a dealership enters into their system on your vehicle! I am sorely disappointed in Honda, especially how they have handled this at the local dealership, and I won't be buying another one.				- John D.,				Perkasie, PA, US"

It is my wife's car and we need it everyday for our daily purpose, I didn't had time to call Honda Corp immediately and ask for any kind of reimbursement, wait for it to happen then get it repaired. I immediately took a rental car for a day while I was getting the Pilot repaired. I checked online and it looks there are a good number of 2016 Honda Pilots that have this same issue. The fuel injector is the heart of a car/SUV and it should work for the life of the car. I have checked online and saw that most of the issues of 2016 Honda Pilot are with Fuel Injector and the repairs are expensive. I understand that a new model of Honda Pilot 2016(completely redesigned vehicle) may have some issues. But this issue is at the heart of the Pilot as it has got to do with the Fuel Injector and needs to be addressed as a Recall by Honda Motor Corp as even the Honda dealer feels that Fuel Injector issue should not happen so early in a car's life.

However, my 3-year-old 2016 Honda Pilot (with 51,000 miles on it) started hesitating about a month ago. Yesterday, the engine light warning popped on: Emissions System Problem. After looking for discussions on this topic via the internet, it seems this is a very common problem with the 2016 Pilots due to prematurely worn fuel injectors. I got a few estimates on the cost to replace these injectors and it's outrageous! Anywhere from $1000 to $1400. This is ridiculous! Even if I had purchased an extended warranty, I'm told this would not be covered as it's not considered part of the power train. I think it is outrageous for Honda to make customers feel this is okay, and should be an expected expense. It's bad enough we've always had to pay close to a $1000 for a timing chain at 100,000 miles. I do NOT believe this problem should be such a huge financial burden on a car this new (just outside of the warranty).

Wires and wire harness are bare. There is a hole in the AC hose system which caused all the ""Freon"" to leak. The plastic covering has melted away.The most recent ""theory"" was that a technician left a towel in the engine compartment after my first oil change and it caught fire - so, too bad, it's $1800 to fix it, thank you. The oil change was almost exactly a month ago and at a different dealer - imagine that?! Funny thing though, when I said the oil change was a month ago, the towel theory was tossed out (of course if they bothered to look at the sticker the other dealer put in the window, they would have seen the date).

This happens independent of stereo operation. Research on the topic shows this is an old problem from the prior generation Pilot, and also exists on Acura TLX. Based on solutions found by forum members, the root cause is an under-engineered circuit for the A/C compressor clutch solenoid. Whenever the solenoid (de)activates the A/C compressor, a spike is emitted through the electrical system. When the vehicle is new, the clutch relays absorb the shock. As the relays wear, they can no longer absorb the electrical shock so the interference is heard through the stereo. Simply replacing relays is a stop-gap measure. The relays will continue to see the spikes and eventually they are ineffective from filtering the spikes. In my video below, the vehicle is only seven months old.				- Amory D.,				Oswego, IL, US"

Manifests in vibration and noise detectable to the passengers. Eventually will lead to damage and need for replacement of the engine mounts. I was unaware of the VCM problem with Hondas when we bought our 2016 Honda Pilot. Our pilot made it almost 36k miles before showing any signs or symptoms of a problem. Before that it was perfect. Then everyday thereafter when cruising at highway speeds, the VCM would engage and disengage as the vehicle went up and down hills. When the vehicle would start uphill, requiring more power, there is a few second lag in the VCM system. For that few seconds when more power is needed but the engine is still running on reduced cylinders, the conditions were just right (or just wrong really) and the vibration would show up. I had the dealership look at my vehicle 3 times, for intermittent vibration issues during highway driving. They reported that they were unable to find any cause, blah blah blah. Then I started researching, found the S-VCM, and figured it was worth a try. It solved my issue entirely.

It is my third Pilot and my other two Pilots ran much smoother than my new one. Sometime in 2017 at about 30,000 miles, I asked my Honda service manager about experiencing the rough acceleration and what I thought was rough shifting. He said there were no adjustments for fuel or acceleration problems. It continued to get worse until my wife started complaining a couple months ago that it wasn't running smooth. I was aware of the problem too but I let it go. I did try some injector cleaner but that did not help. It continued to get worse rather quickly. Today the same Honda service manager agreed to look at my car. Guess what? He found an extended warranty tech bulletin 17-014 dealing with a torque converter problem making the acceleration ""stutter"" in his words. They changed the tranny fluid and reprogrammed something in the tranny at no cost to me. I signed the warranty invoice that showed cost of $238 paid by Honda. I just got home with the car and it seems to be fixed with a smoother shifting sequence. Yeah!!! What a relief and now I love my Pilot like I did my other two before this one.				- johncooper,				Manhattan, US"

After reading complaint after complaint, forum after forum, I am reading that it could possibly be due to the VCM technology using 3 cylinders and not the 6 like it should which is causing all of this which will lead to engine/transmission damage early on. I am very disappointed having spent $40,000 on a new Honda vehicle that had a reputation of being reliable. I noticed after having my car for 1 year that it was leaking oil and I mentioned it to the dealership, but I got no answers from them. I also mentioned to them and asked why my car was burning so much oil so quickly. I always had them use full synthetic oil on my car and I would have it changed out like regular oil every 3,000 or 3 months. I'm sure the dealership did not report it on their end, of course, and they did not have answers for me either. I am so mad. I either have to find a way to disable the VCM or trade my car in.

3413,Honda,Pilot,2017,transmission problems,Hard Shifting,Pilot EX,Automatic transmission,"66,480 miles"," I had previously thought very highly of Honda, that it sold good quality, reliable cars. My opinion has since changed with the 2017 Honda Pilot as this has been my worst car experience. At 5 years, the transmission failed, and I was stuck with a defective part that should never have failed this soon. This defect is well known and discussed on Honda forums and with so many existing issues, it seems like an unfair business practice to require the consumer to be responsible for footing the bill for a product defect. There are many consumer complaints about this.The timeline for my situation occurred just after the 65,000-mile warranty. My transmission began failing at 66,480 miles so I brought it to the dealer on December 1, 2021. The dealer performed a service and mentioned this would be the first step to repair the problem with the transmission. A few months later, at 71,033 miles, the transmission system warning light came on, and I brought it back to the dealer March 23, 2022 at which time I was told that the transmission would need to be replaced at a cost of $9,000. The dealership told me they would do me a favor and ‘share the cost’ with me so my portion would only be $5,300. I tried to negotiate further claiming a defective part, but the dealership wouldn’t budge and in fact told me that if I didn’t take the offer, they would rescind the offer. I needed a car so I agreed to pay it. I had to uber around for a couple days at the cost of $63 then I had to rent a car for $1,636. I also did quite a bit of research on what the problem was with this transmission, what internal parts actually failed, and how long this repair should take. The notion that I had marginally exceeded the warranty so the defect isn’t covered seems harsh, poor customer care, or just an excuse to avoid responsibility for manufacturing and selling a faulty part. This event is likely related to an internal failure (the clutch failing prematurely) something that should not have occurred this soon. The vehicle has been well maintained and the transmission fluid was serviced at 40,270 miles in June 2020. I was also told that if I had serviced my car 100% at honda then I would have received a better deal? This doesn’t make sense as the only service I had outside of the dealership was oil and tires – unrelated to a faulty transmission. To make matters worse, the service advisor was a challenge to deal with. I initially asked how long it would take to repair – he advised a couple days to get the part and a couple days to repair. I checked in with him daily and each day he seemed to have a new story. The advisor even told me he’d work on getting me a car to rent/borrow but he never followed up on this. I checked every day for a week and the part didn’t arrive until April 1. I was told that same day, the car was on lifts and being worked on so it would be done “Monday”, “no Tuesday”, “no Wednesday.” I did not feel as though I was getting the truth – it was a complete run around, but I was at the mercy of the dealership. I had already researched this and learned from the internet that it would likely take 2 weeks for this car/this transmission to be repaired. I learned this from the internet, so why didn’t the service advisor just tell me this in advance instead of feeding me a daily story that was unrealistic? If he didn’t know the timeframe, wouldn’t he ask a supervisor or shop manager for guidance? It was finally completed exactly 2 weeks from the day I brought it in – April 6 but I couldn’t pick it up until the next day since I was told so late in the day that it was complete. (I had to coordinate returning the rental car and getting a ride to the dealership).A product should meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer. When a product has an unexpected defect, the product cannot be said to meet the ordinary expectations of the consumer. When the product is defective, it is irrelevant whether the manufacturer exercised great care to design and/or manufacture a quality product – in the end, the part was defective and should be recalled. This transmission should have at least lasted until 130,000-150,000 miles. It is negligent for Honda to knowingly keep selling or refusing to replace a part that is defective. I don’t believe it is right to charge me to repair the cost of a defective product. I can tell you that based on this experience (and unless this situation is made right) I would never purchase a Honda again – the reputation of Honda has now been tarnished so badly that I no longer feel that Honda sells quality, reliable cars nor do they back up their products. It's not the right thing to do to treat a customer like this. It’s not right to avoid responsibility for defective products.				- Meme P.,				Littleton, US"

I took it back to them and after two days they told me that they had been grinding on the glass to remove the stains and that they were acceptable now. I can still see grinding imprints in the glass. This was my 5th new Honda that I have purchased. After this experience it will be my last.				- Kevin S.,				East Alton, IL, US"
3420,Honda,Pilot,2017,body / paint problems,Hood Flexing,Pilot ES,Automatic transmission,500 miles,"I have complained to Honda every time I went in for an oil change. There is a loud whistling noise when you reach speeds of 65mph or higher. Then when my husband lifted the hood to look and see if he could see anything to cause the noise he noticed there was a black shield that ran across the front under the hood that is supposed to keep debris out from under the hood. It is constantly coming loose because of the hood flexing so bad. We then noticed the insulation that covers the inside top of the hood had water marks on it. Before you know it the remote starter doesn't work and the windows go up and down by themselves. When I talk to service about it they said I have to come back when there's less traffic so they can get on the interstate. Your in Tampa, there's always traffic. I drive far for work and now have 21,000 miles on it and they have yet to even look at it.				- Jamie F.,				Dade City, FL, US"

3422,Honda,Pilot,2017,body / paint problems,Hood Flexing,Pilot EX-L V6,Automatic transmission,600 miles,"At highway speeds, especially on windy days & 2-lane roads, when being passed by an oncoming large vehicle, the hood jumps, shudders & flexes like it's not fully latched. The first time it happened, I pulled over to make sure the hood is actually latched, not just on the safety latch. The hood is completely latched & has no perceivable play in either the latch or hinges. Something is flexing or stretching badly. In an extreme situation I have seen the hood raise in excess of 2 inches. I have to believe the metal of the hood or hinges or latch components or all of the above are flexing uncontrollably. The selling dealer in Jacksonville, Illinois & a dealership in Winter Haven Florida have both said they have had no such complaints & see no problem. The facts & numbers of similar complaints on this site say otherwise. Recently, one of my neighbors purchased a new Pilot & experiences the same thing. I am 75 yrs. old & have owned automobiles since the early 60's & never had such a problem. Our 2013 Accord has a very slight shudder of the hood under the same conditions but not anywhere as severe & I never noticed it until our new Pilot did it often & much more severely. If the manufacturer will not take ownership of this problem, I will pursue the Lemon Law, & if that fails, I will trade it off. I've had a good run with Honda vehicles up til now. Our 2017 Pilot is the 10th Honda we've owned since 1987. We have passed down every old Honda to our children & grandchildren. Most of them are still on the road with hundreds of thousands of trouble free miles. This problem is unacceptable & not what loyal Honda customers are used to.

3426,Honda,Pilot,2017,AC / heater problems,Very Weak Floor Heat,Pilot LX V6,Automatic transmission,"5,000 miles"," click to see larger imagesI found three problems causing lack of heat on our feet in late model Honda Pilots. This is based upon my 2017 Pilot LX.First -- Honda apparently designed the ""feet only"" setting to also split air to the windshield. This is just like the setting that splits it between the window defrost and floor heat. Exactly like it on my 2017. If you adjust the setting from ""defrost and floor"" to just ""floor"", the air flow does not change AT ALL going to the windshield. Honda Master Tech verified this at a Honda dealership, but would not declare it a problem since all the other Hondas checked did it to some degree also.Second -- under the dash and above the gas pedal is the terribly designed ""splitter elbow vent"" for distributing the floor air. It is WAY too restrictive. I removed this ""splitter elbow vent"" and modified it by machining the openings MUCH larger. See attached pictures.Third -- the ""splitter elbow vent"" snaps into a flimsy plastic manifold up under the dash. When I first removed it, it was not snapped in place. So a large percentage of the heated air was leaking out into the dash.We can fix the second and third problems -- it is not comfortable to get to that ""splitter elbow vent"" -- but once it is opened up and properly snapped into the manifold up under the dash, then the amount of air blowing on my feet increased two to three times! Much better situation for winter in the Midwest! Note that I don't like to run my heater fan above ""3"" indicators as the really high fan settings like 4+ are quite loud. But if the fan speed is cranked up my feet get hot. And my eyes dry out from all the split air coming off the windshield defroster vents...Hope this helps some people!				- Beth H.,				Franklin, OH, US"

The only way to get it operable again would be to turn it off then turn it back on. This problem started happening really randomly maybe once a month or even once every 2 months. Now its every other week sometimes every time I start my car in the am. When I took it in to Honda. Honda's answer to this issue was "" could not duplicate concern at this time bring it in when it happens again"". The next time it happened, I didn't touch the radio I drove straight to Honda and had the service writer look at it and this time it was finally confirmed by the service writer. The service writer told me he'll do some configurations and it worked for 3 weeks. After 3 weeks it started happening again radio started to just knock off again. This time when I took it in the service writer said he would try and get an approval for a new radio. Well guess what no approval because ""unable to duplicate customers concerns"". I told the service writer ""you were there you confirmed the problem with the radio"" he said regardless, the tech could not duplicate it and they would try to up date the computer instead and see how that works.

Here is where it could have been catastrophic as I could not even turn on my flashers to warn (in low visibility) that I was stopped while all other traffic was flowing. In neither case did I require a jump start and I have never had any reason to blame the battery. Even in the winter, the car starts right up (here in Virginia).

This is my 4th Honda, and I have never had this issue before and find it interesting that this never happened until a year after I purchased the vehicle. If it was designed this way, why did it not happen for the first year? I also know other people who have CRV's and Pilots the same year as my Pilot and they do not have this issue, so I'm not sure how some Hondas are designed to do this and others are not!

3462,Honda,Pilot,2018,brakes problems,Collision Mitigation Braking System,Pilot Elite,Automatic transmission,150 miles," We purchased a 2018 Honda Pilot Elite in October 2018. The night we picked the vehicle up from the dealer, the Collision Mitigation Braking System (CMBS) engaged twice with no possible collision in sight. My husband was driving and it really startled him. I called our salesman the next morning and described what happened. He said that it was most likely the Lane Keep Assist and that we just need to get used to the new technology. After some research, it seemed like it possibly was the Lane Keep Assist, but we didn't think my husband ever went out of the lanes so we kept our eyes on the issue. Over the next month and a half we continued to experience the CMBS engaging when there was no possible collision. It happened so frequently that I contacted a local dealer immediately. The dealer said that it needed to be recalibrated and that should fix the issue. It did not fix the issue. The vehicle has been back to the same dealer 5 times. One time they ended up fixing the alignment that they said was out from the factory. After they fixed the alignment, the CMBS does not engage as frequently but it still happens often, sporadically and always when no collision is possible. Honda Customer Service refuses to investigate the issue since the dealer says they fixed the issue and they are no longer able to recreate it. The CMBS does not throw any errors and the dealership has no idea what is wrong and how to fix it. I am not the only one having this problem, yet Honda does not want to acknowledge or address the issue.Update from Dec 16, 2019: This issue occurred last week and was the scariest incident yet! It was raining and CMBS engaged with no possible collision in sight. When the vehicle automatically applied the brakes, the car skidded due to the wet roads and could have caused a serious accident. I have contacted Honda Customer Service and the dealership and neither one have returned my calls. I am taking it to a different dealership on Saturday. I noticed others having similar complaints on this site but they are in the Miscellaneous category and one is reported as Lane Keep Assist but that is not LKA. LKA does not flash the word ""BRAKE"" on the dash, CMBS does!				- Kris A.,				Santa Rosa, US"

Our vehicle was almost impacted by the truck behind us because he assumed I would be able to speed up instead of having to come to a complete stop. This has happened at least 20 more times since then when I forget to turn off the automatic start/stop feature. It's always when I'm coming to a stop, the suv will not turn back on mostly its inconvenient to drivers behind me that feel I just didn't see the light turn green but a couple of times it has happened when approaching metering lights in the freeway where the cars behind me or in the lane next to me are ready to accelerate not knowing that my car will have to come to a complete stop because of this issue before I car start the car again.							- Vacaville , CA, USA"

3465,Honda,Pilot,2018,brakes problems,NHTSA: Service Brakes,Pilot, miles,,"			I was stopped at a stop light and the car was in auto engine idle. After releasing the brake when the light turned green, the engine shut off and the dash told me to put the car in park and restart by pushing the brake and hitting the engine start button. This process took about 30 seconds for the car to finally restart and I was sitting in the middle of traffic with cars behind me that had anticipated me moving forward when the light changed. Several warning symbols popped up including the collision mitigation system. This is an easy way to get rear-ended. In other instances, I have had issues where the radio and engine shuts off after releasing the brake when in auto engine idle at a stop light or driving in slower traffic but it kicks back on in just a second with no need to stop and restart.

3474,Honda,Pilot,2018,brakes problems,NHTSA: Electronic Stability Control,Pilot,"10,000 miles",,"			My 2018 Honda Pilot elite turns on the ""auto idle stop"" feature each time I start the vehicle. Basically, this means that the engine shuts off when I'm at a complete stop. When I release the brake, the engine starts again. However, there is lag time between the time I release the brake and acceleration. This has nearly caused a deathly accident on more than a dozen occasions during the past 6 months at intersections. I've nearly been T-boned each and every time because the vehicle will simply not accelerate at the precise moment when I need it to. There is over a 1 second lag before acceleration occurs. Perhaps this is meant to be an emissions control feature, but it comes at the price of safety. This ""auto idle stop"" feature makes the vehicle completely unsafe to drive for families. There should be a permanent on/off switch rather than having to turn this feature off each and every time I start the vehicle. Completely unsafe! 							- Rogersville, TN, USA"

I previously reported second row passenger seatbelt that was found completely detached from anchor, at point where belt was looped and sewn. This was replaced by dealer. The second row middle belt locked in extended position at that time, and I requested dealer check this and repair or replace as needed. This was supposedly also done. The row 2 middle belt is rarely used, using first time since repair was reportedly done, found webbing that is frayed 50%+ through, in portion that is retracted when not being used. I checked all belts when I found this, and found fraying at the 3rd row middle seatbelt (buckle portion webbing), with associated damage to the plastic where the third row seat folds down. It appears the belt webbing has been rubbing on this plastic part of seat back, causing damage. This belt is also rarely used: not at all in last 13 months, and around 5-6 times, every 6-10 weeks in non-pandemic times. The third row is normally kept folded down, with the middle row belt retracted into ceiling when not in use. I am left wondering if the geometry of the belt placement is causing mechanical/friction damage, if there are sharp edges in the 2nd row middle belt storage (overhead), or if there was chemical damage to some belts in the factory. It is odd and concerning to find multiple issues with the belts, and I want all to be replaced, and their housing inspected for possible points causing the damage. 							- Seminole, FL, USA"

However, there is lag time between the time I release the brake and acceleration. This has nearly caused a deathly accident on more than a dozen occasions during the past 6 months at intersections. I've nearly been T-boned each and every time because the vehicle will simply not accelerate at the precise moment when I need it to. There is over a 1 second lag before acceleration occurs. Perhaps this is meant to be an emissions control feature, but it comes at the price of safety. This ""auto idle stop"" feature makes the vehicle completely unsafe to drive for families. There should be a permanent on/off switch rather than having to turn this feature off each and every time I start the vehicle. Completely unsafe! 							- Rogersville, TN, USA"

I think this is extremely dangerous and I am scared this will cause a terrible accident if not fixed.

Upon coming to a complete stop, the Auto Stop function disables the engine. Upon releasing the brake, the system is supposed to restart the engine. However, on at least five occasions the engine has not restarted, and it has required her to turn the vehicle off and completely restart it as if starting from cold. This has occurred at stop lights, which obviously could cause safety issues/implications. On at least a couple of the occasions, she had to attempt to restart the vehicle multiple times by applying the brakes and pressing the main start/stop button). I frequently drive the vehicle and always turn off the Auto Start/Stop function. I have never run into these issues whatsoever.

3555,Honda,Pilot,2018,drivetrain problems,NHTSA: Power Train,Pilot, miles,,"			We bought the Honda Pilot to tow a NuCamp 2019 Tab 320 Bookdock Trailer, which has a gross dry weight of 1,848 pounds (well below the 3,500-pound Pilot published towing capacity). We tow the trailer dry, which is without water in the black, gray and fresh tanks. We do not load any items of significant weight in the trailer (two lightweight camp chairs, a 3-inch thick foam mattress topper and pillows). We have towed the trailer from Akron, Ohio, to Twentynine Palms, CA, in 2020 and to Glacier National Park, MT, in 2021. We have also towed it to several Ohio state parks. In the fall of 2021, the vehicle-€™s transmission began to exhibit unusual performance that manifested itself as gear shifting hesitation in the range of 1,500 -€"" 2,000 RPMs. With that issue, we took it to Great Lakes Honda which changed the transmission fluid (Great Lakes did not flush the transmission) at 28,000 miles. On April 3, 2022, the transmission hesitation began again. I took it to Apple Tree Honda in Arden, NC, (we had moved to Waynesville, NC, in late 2021) on April 5, 2022, a technician found no error codes, but performed a transmission flush and fill.. My issue with this is that the transmission fluid should not degrade in 7,000 miles of normal driving, causing transmission malfunction. The vehicle does seem capable of towing a weight near the published owner's manual maximum of 3,500 pounds. With this interval, I am concerned that the Honda stated operational guidelines are false, and the vehicle-€™s transmission might continue to degrade as many other Honda Pilots-€™ transmissions have as reported by many owners. The Apple Tree Honda technician who worked on the Pilot, advised me to add an auxiliary automatic transmission cooler, which is necessary if towing more than 3500 lbs. Since the April service, I have not towed the trailer. I am fearful that the transmission will fail when I am towing the trailer. 							- Waynesville, NC, USA"

I had taken it to the dealership and they claimed they could not reproduce the problem. I took the vehicle home, then later that day I drove it approximately 17 miles to a racetrack that I work at part time. At 12:30 am, I was leaving to head home, and while idling in the parking lot, it had died yet again and took several minutes to restart. Once it did restart, I had no throttle response in park, neutral or in drive. I shut the vehicle off and restarted it with no other issues for the 17 mile trip back home. The dealership suggested that I take picture/video when it happens, which poses another safety concern to do that in the event I am driving when this event occurs. This is a severe safety concern as there is the potential for the engine to die/stall during a hard braking event in which I could lose power brakes. Only the dealership has inspected the vehicle, and the only lights that have been illuminated on the dash was the battery light and the caution light.

Unfortunately during this first winter I have found out that this vehicle does not have a functioning heater. As soon as the weather turned cold I noticed that this new Honda Pilot did not have sufficient heat. While driving at highway speeds the heater functions ok but during city driving, or especially at idle, the temperature falls well below any acceptable minimum requirements. Below is a chart showing a comparison between a functioning heater in a 2014 CRV versus this new 2018 Honda Pilot. Please note the differences in outside air temperatures: The CRV measurements were taken at an outside air temp of -8 while the Pilot data was recorded with an outside air temp of + 8. the vent temperature varies considerably based on the engine RPM. While accelerating the temperature is warm / hot but while driving in traffic or stopped the temperature can drop 80 degrees or more in 1-2 minutes. Based on this data, I made two separate appointments to have the Pilot serviced under warranty at my local Honda dealer. The weather on the 2nd visit was cold (-17 degrees F). They 'verified the complaint' and found that the vent temperature from a fully warmed up engine was 28 degrees (yes, below freezing!). they said they have another Pilot in their shop that does the same thing therefore there is nothing wrong with mine and considered mine as functioning 'normal'. they did not do any diagnostic work and refused to do any work, even simple work such as trying to flush the heater core or remove any air from the system. They stated that Honda put in an undersized heater core in the Pilot and therefore they were not going to waste their time trying to fix. Since I live in Chicago there are 5 months of cold weather so I do not consider a lack of heat a minor inconvenience nor an acceptable to live with.							- Hoffman Estates, IL, USA"

This issue has also occurred while slowing to take a sharp corner. The engine died at approximately 25 mph while slowing for the corner. I had taken it to the dealership and they claimed they could not reproduce the problem. I took the vehicle home, then later that day I drove it approximately 17 miles to a racetrack that I work at part time. At 12:30 am, I was leaving to head home, and while idling in the parking lot, it had died yet again and took several minutes to restart. Once it did restart, I had no throttle response in park, neutral or in drive. I shut the vehicle off and restarted it with no other issues for the 17 mile trip back home. The dealership suggested that I take picture/video when it happens, which poses another safety concern to do that in the event I am driving when this event occurs. This is a severe safety concern as there is the potential for the engine to die/stall during a hard braking event in which I could lose power brakes. Only the dealership has inspected the vehicle, and the only lights that have been illuminated on the dash was the battery light and the caution light. This issue has been going on for approximately a month and a half.

My husband and 3 young kids were merging onto airport property on a extremely busy afternoon, my vehicle stalled. It was like a complete electrical failure. I was left stranded at 7pm, in dark, with 3 scared children, unable to alert other hostile drivers around me by turning on flashers. After not being about to push vehicle out way of heavy traffic, I was forced to call my insurance company for assistance which proved to be a serious challenge due to the horns and derogatory language of other drivers and as a result my children having an emotional breakdown in the back seat. My husband was forced to leave the kids and I in this very dangerous situation in order to get to our 14 yr old daughter (traveling alone) off her flight. Once police arrived, they parked unit behind me in order to protect us from being hit. The police searched manual and internet and were unable to get vehicle into emergency neutral. The vehicle had to be drug onto tow truck and towed to dealership. 2 days later, Honda informed me it was a ""dead battery."" ""battery?"" I have been driving for over 20 year and have never been left on highway, in motion due to a battery. After some reading of my own, I learned about a fuel saving feature on my car called ""auto idle-stop"". with this feature my engine shuts off when brake compressed in order to save on fuel. With a dead battery, the battery was unable to restart vehicle. So basically this fuel saving feature turns out to be a serious safety problem because instead of being stranded in a parking lot, I was stranded in the middle of a highway. After further reading about this feature, I learned that my vehicle should have automatically enabled this auto-idle if battery charge was low, which did not happen. 							- Paulina, LA, USA"

Then the problem just kept getting worse, it caused the main dashboard to shut off while I was driving. I couldn't see how fast i was going or how many miles were on my vehicle. Honda headquarters kept ignoring the issue. Saying its no big deal. The problem got so bad one day that my car wouldn't start and i had to get a tow truk to tow my vehicle to the dealership. I brought it to the dealership to have it fixed, they had no idea what the problem was. They went ahead and replaced the entire media screen and wiring. My car was in the shop for 3 weeks. I finally got my car back In June. You wont believe it, the issue came back this time think got worse very quickly. Right now both my entertainment screen and dashboard are blank. This is extremely dangerous, by back up camera doesn't work, I have no idea how fast I'm driving, not to mention I can't use my phone or listen to the music. I called Honda Headquarters again and told them about my issue. Jeff the regional director who was handling my case told me to take it back to the dealership to have it fixed. I asked Jeff if he knew that there was a class action law suit against Honda for the very same issue im having. He got very defensive and told me it was a software program and that Apple car play is the issue. Is that a joke????? I told him that the dealerships have no idea what the issue is and arent able to fix the problem because of an engineering issue that Honda is responsible for. Jeff ""the regional director"" got so defensive and hung up on me. Unprofessional. This is a crime for Honda to continue selling these vehicles and very dangerous for drivers to be driving these vehicles. Honda should be prosecuted and held accountable. I am now looking in to the Lemon Laws in the state of NY. My vehicle has been in the shop for over 30 days for the same issue. I encourage all Honda Drivers to exercise their rights and demand a refund. Shame on you HONDA!!!				- Lionel A.,				Brooklyn, NY, US"
3628,Honda,Pilot,2019,electrical problems,Infotainment System Frozen,Pilot EX-L,Automatic transmission,260 miles,"click to see larger imagesEver since I purchased the brand new car I've had issues with the infotainment center. A few times a week i will get an error while listening to Sirius radio that says ""Unfortunately, Sirius XM has stopped"" . The whole system freezes and none of the controls work. I need to shut the audio off and turn back on for it to work again. This has gone on for 9 months. This is often accompanied with a ""Check tuner"" error message. Yesterday this issue got even worse and has spread to the radio part itself. The entire radio stopped working mid drive today, with an error message saying ""Radio Unavailable"". Neither the radio, Sirius XM, or phone works. I turned the car completely off and the issue still remained. After leaving the car off for 8 hours, it turned on and worked fine. Completely hit or miss with this issue. I ignored the Sirius XM issue at first because a simple turning the audio on an off fixed it (even though its ridiculous to have to do that with a 40k car) but this new issue with the whole radio not working is unacceptable. We'll see what the dealer says, but i worry i will be unlucky like others here with their infotainment center issues.				- Sean F.,				Amherst, US"

Audio was coming from Apple Music through CarPlay. Tried disconnecting and reconnecting phone with no luck. Tried wife's iPhone as well and still no luck. Then tried different audio sources (AM, FM, CD, Blu-Ray) and even tried the built in Garmin Navigation and none were working! Screen on instrument cluster read ""Audio Off"" no matter what input was selected. Every input would display a message about Radio or Audio Unavailable and wouldn't load. Finally we pulled off the freeway to turn off the ignition and open driver side door to turn off Infotainment System, hoping that a restart would help. BUT, THE INFOTAINMENT SYSTEM WOULD NOT SHUT OFF!!! After browsing the menu's looking for way's to reset the system, clearing the cache from different apps and just waiting and praying for the system to shut off, we found a solution on the Piloteers.org:Opening the fuse box under the hood on the passenger side, removing fuse #19 and waiting 10 second before replacing the fuse restarted the infotainment system. The system was back to normal after this with no problems since.Browsing around Piloteers.org we found this to be a very common problem on the '19 Pilot but after seeing the great lengths others have gone through to fix the problem (Tearing the vehicle apart to install a New Wiring Harnesses, New Infotainment Systems or even trying a Brand New Vehicle) only to have the same problem (and potentially more since their vehicles were taken apart), we have decided to live with it in hopes Honda will issue a software fix. This problem is unacceptable for a $50,000 vehicle especially since it renders the system completely useless while driving. Honda please fix this issue now!				- ttyrell,				Los Osos, US"

It acted like this intermittently.The end of March I left it at the airport for a week and when I returned at midnight The car would not start!

In April my car would not start at 3 pm in the afternoon in my garage, then it wouldn't start at 5 pm in the afternoon after work. I left it overnight at the dealer and of course they could find nothing. They were stating that perhaps I wasn't placing enough pressure on the brakes to start it. You know, because I am a female! I called Honda financial and opened a case at this point because the car is only a few months old. They informed me of a timing belt issue which may be the cause. I took the car to the dealer who checked and that belt was not in my car so they did not change it. They also ""ran tests again"" and found nothing wrong.May 9th I was on my way to work I stopped for an errand and the car would not start. I called Honda care for it to be towed to the Honda dealer to be looked at in that condition. It was over a half an hour before I could be towed there.

I feel like I'm forced to live with this problem until something major happens and it's really unfair.We had a string of Hyundai vehicles before switching to Honda.

Shortly after driving the car I noticed a squeak in engine compartment when I let up on gas or brakes applied. Mileage was less than 1,600. I took it into the Dealer in June. Dealer said it was transmission (FIRST REPAIR ATTEMPT) and ordered new transmission. Early July brought in the car to have transmission replaced. Honda Technical Rep said it wasn’t the transmission. Recommended to replace engine mounts (SECOND REPAIR ATTEMPT). Engine mounts were replaced. Squeak was still present. After extensive test drive, Honda said it was from A/C and Honda Tech said to perform deep A/C vacuum/drying (THIRD REPAIR ATTEMPT). After A/C vacuum/drying the squeak was still there. Honda Tech then said it was A/C expansion valve. But, Honda refused to replace the valve. They stated it “IS A NORMAL CHARACTERISTIC OF THE VEHICLE”.I was told by Dealer that three other customers had complained about same squeak and they also found a new car on lot with same issue.In July I contacted Honda Customer Care. In August Honda Customer Care told me my claim was denied and that the squeak in the engine – A/C - was a normal characteristic. Customer Care Rep indicated that they were handling other customer complainants with the same issue. My complaint was closed.Since when is a squeak in a brand-new car a normal characteristic? If Honda really thought it was a normal characteristic why did they continue to try to fix my car. It wasn’t until they couldn’t fix it after three attempts and Honda refused to replace the A/C expansion valve that they decided it was a normal characteristic.

Then came a recall for a defective timing belt and now AC is making a noise (best I can describe it is like a hiccup noise). The noise is noticeable when AC is on and when the weather gets hot. I brought the Pilot back to the dealer and left it there for 4 days. Initially, the mechanic was unable to hear the noise and I insisted to let them keep the Pilot for several days because the past several days were raining and the weather wasn't that hot. Finally, the Vegas weather went back to normal which is >100F and the noise occurred. The mechanic was able to verify the AC noise but not aware of how to address it. The dealer contacted Honda and per dealer, Honda is aware of the issue and there was a service bulletin for it. Honda calls it ""flute"" noise and it was caused by an AC expansion valve. Honda advised the dealer to not replace any parts and basically to tell the customer that Honda is aware of the issue. There is no ETA for the fix so the dealer advised contacting Honda directly (800-999-1009) and create a case as a reference - just in case a fix is found and the 36k warranty has passed, so we're not liable for any parts and labor. Per dealer, they will fix the issue even after 36K if its AC expansion valve-related because they have it in their record.Update from Sep 11, 2019: Update:My issue progresses to the AC compressor making a rattle noise. I brought it back to the dealer for follow-up diagnosis, and dealer determined it was related to the expansion valve issue previously diagnosed. The service tech again claimed that there is a Technical Service Bulletin for it. This time I demanded to see the TSB and I got the service manager involved. The service manager reached out to his tech and asked for the TSB info to be printed, and when the so-called TSB was handed to me, it was actually a screenshot from a forum where the dealer tech goes to and ask other dealers or tech for advice. There is NO TSB for it. The dealer lied about it. This is the printed forum thread commented by RyanB.""So there has been an uptick of calls regarding a Hoot/Chrip noise from under the hood on decel. The noise will go away if you turn off the AC. This seems to be affecting 2019 Pilots Touring and Elite because both have a variable compressor, so we are finding out it has characteristic noises. This noise seems to be most noticeable on HOT days 90F plus while in decel 2000-1500 RPM. Engineering is looking into this noise, and there is no suggested parts replacement at this time. There are no AC performance issues from this noise. Most variable compressors make some type of noise, but it is mostly addressed in the development of that system.""I opened a case with Honda Customer Service and was advised to get a 2nd opinion from another dealer.  I brought my Pilot to a 2nd dealer and left it there for almost a week, and the dealer was able to duplicate the issue - I had to drive and let a dealer's tech ridealong to point out the origin of the problem because initially, they didn't know what to look for. I was told with the exact info that the problem was from an expansion valve and the variable compressor. They also reference the same info from the forum. I guess all dealers go to this forum for answers (or to BS their way out of addressing an issue).The tech that ridealong commented that he's willing to replace the part, but it's up to Honda to give him the go-ahead. He also pointed out that the expansion valve is located behind the firewall and he will need to pull the dashboard out to get to it and get it replaced. He's seriously wanted to help and do all the work, but Honda refused to authorize the work. I think this is one of the reasons why Honda doesn't want to address this issue - just the enormity of the job entails of replacing the defective parts. Per the tech, it will take him a day to get the valve replaced. Honda CS called back to deliver the message that the problem will not be fixed. CS basically relayed the dealer's recommendations. CS also suggested that the noise may be a characteristic of the new variable compressor, which is an absolute BS. What automobile manufacturer produces an SUV with a ridiculous and annoying noise and consider it as a typical characteristic? CS closed the ticket and said they couldn't do anything about it unless they get further instructions from Honda. In other words, Honda gave us the middle finger and said: ""deal with it.""

The lane in which I was driving (right) slowed down, so moved to the left lane. That lane was also slowing as I can see the cars in the front slowing down and stopping. My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy.

When the SUV was put in drive, the vehicle rolled forward. When the brake pedal was pushed, it would not stop. Brakes were pumped several times. After hitting the vehicle in front of us, that driver pulled forward. The Pilot began to roll. The vehicle was steered to the right and eventually rolled to a stop on the parking lot - pumping the brakes the whole way. The vehicle was turned off. When we turned the vehicle back on, we were not able to recreate the issue. The vehicle was still in warranty, but Honda kept the vehicle more than a week and could not recreate the problem. They were unwilling to fix or replace any of the brake components. They were, of course, willing to trade it in and sell us another! Very disappointing. Anytime the vehicle is under warranty, a reputable company will repair a vehicle. That tells us what we needed to know about the integrity there. Safety is always a priority, period. No exceptions.

The lane in which I was driving (right) slowed down, so moved to the left lane. That lane was also slowing as I can see the cars in the front slowing down and stopping. My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy. When informed about this to Honda, Honda was referring to geico, that they will do the investigation. Geico says that its not their problem and Honda should do the investigation. As a common man I would like to have this problem investigated and necessary action to be taken. I see they subrogate each other, which is not correct. I'm not sure how many cars are running in this condition on the road. Please do take necessary steps to check on this. I can give all the required documents, pictures and police reports in this regard. I need assistance in investigation of this accident and find out why the car did not respond.

In my case, on 2/13/20 the starter malfunctioned at < 7000 miles-it has since been replaced. I was in a parking garage, and no structure trucks were available to tow from the spot the car was disabled. The plan was to put it into neutral and push it to the street where it could be towed. The owner's manual does not tell what to do. The dealer didn't know, either. If it's googled, a youtube video comes up, that identifies an oddly shaped device or bolt deep in the engine compartment. But even the aaa mechanic who came to the scene, with all his tools, could not get it to turn. I asked the dealership if there was any other way and ultimately they said ""no."" They later told me, after doing some research, that Honda has a special tool, requiring three extensions, used to accomplish this during Transport to the dealer. This seem quite unsafe. Obviously, cars can be disabled in many ways. Without a reasonably accessible means of putting the car in neutral, it cannot be moved in an emergency situation (for example, out of a lane of traffic). It definitely can't be done by an owner (unless, I suppose it's someone who has the ability to google during the emergency, finds the video, and has the special tool). Please note the car wash feature will not work because the engine has to be running for that. When I first brought this up, no one at the dealership knew anything about this defect. I have since learned that most cars have a shift lock override lever easily accessible in the passenger compartment, often on or near the shift console. In my conversation with the dealership, they say that 2020 Pilot and 2019 and 2020 passports also have this design. I do not know how many other vehicles are affected.

3817,Honda,Pilot,2019,fuel system problems,NHTSA: Fuel/Propulsion System,Pilot, miles,,"			Auto stop start is erratically failing to properly restart the car after brake has been disengaged. After arriving at a complete stop, the vehicle will properly shut down when the driver-€™s foot is on the brake. When the driver disengages the brakes, the engine should promptly restart and the car will find itself already in drive so it can continue to move forward. Under certain unknown circumstances, the car will stall and not be allowed to restart. In order to continue, I needed to shift the car to park, turn the car off completely, and then restart the car. Only then can I shift the car back to drive and continue. This presents a safety issue since once the brakes are removed, traffic behind interprets this action to mean you will be traveling forward shortly. The restart is sometimes accompanied by a lurk which might be also considered as moving forward. This vehicle has not been in a accident and the dealer was not able to reproduce this issue. The issue seemed to occur shortly after another recall was performed for the fuel pump. Auto stop start cannot be permanently disabled and needs to be performed each time the car is started.

He says he will NOT be able to accommodate the loaner car. When I challenge him, he then says he will be able to provide me a loan car. I ask him exactly what they will be doing and he proceeds to tell me they remove the back seat of the vehicle, go through an access door.... IN THE CAB OF THE VEHICLE, remove the fuel pump THROUGH the cab of the vehicle, and replace the fuel pump with a new fuel pump. He verified that this fix will result in gas fumes IN THE CAB OF MY VEHICLE!!!! I am a 66YO, Type 1 diabetic.

3838,Honda,Pilot,2019,miscellaneous problems,NHTSA: Unknown Or Other,Pilot, miles,,"			Auto stop start is erratically failing to properly restart the car after brake has been disengaged. After arriving at a complete stop, the vehicle will properly shut down when the driver-€™s foot is on the brake. When the driver disengages the brakes, the engine should promptly restart and the car will find itself already in drive so it can continue to move forward. Under certain unknown circumstances, the car will stall and not be allowed to restart. In order to continue, I needed to shift the car to park, turn the car off completely, and then restart the car. Only then can I shift the car back to drive and continue. This presents a safety issue since once the brakes are removed, traffic behind interprets this action to mean you will be traveling forward shortly. The restart is sometimes accompanied by a lurk which might be also considered as moving forward. This vehicle has not been in a accident and the dealer was not able to reproduce this issue. The issue seemed to occur shortly after another recall was performed for the fuel pump. Auto stop start cannot be permanently disabled and needs to be performed each time the car is started. This circumstance seems documented in PE22005.							- Plainfield, IN, USA"

My attempts to stop the car proved futile. The car did not stop. 1) repeated pumping of the breaks did not yield to stop the car. Honda Pilot collided with the car in the front. 2) the cars system to slow the car while approaching a vehicle in the front did not function. 3) airbags did not deploy at all - none of the airbags deployed. - collision center was literally baffling, over this - have no clue how the airbags did not deploy with this kind of a collision. I seriously suspect that there is some thing seriously flawed. Since I'm not an automobile engineer, I'm not sure of technicality involved in this. Something went wrong terribly, that the car did not stop on braking, car did not slow down, & the airbags did not deploy. When informed about this to Honda, Honda was referring to geico, that they will do the investigation. Geico says that its not their problem and Honda should do the investigation.

The collision avoidance system repeatedly recognized the snow as a vehicle and repeatedly applied the brakes at highway speed in heavy traffic. It happened from Davenport, IA to Des Moines, IA on 14 Jan 22. It also repeatedly tried to steer because the lane keeper assist kept malfunctioning. On Sunday 16 Jan 22 we returned from Des Moines to Davenport and it repeatedly happened again. On Sunday the roads were clear and there wasn't any precipitation in the air. I washed the windshield and wiped off the sensor panel but it didn't stop. The Honda dealer in Moline, IL told me that there was nothing they could do. They said that happens in snow and rain and that I should wash the vehicle. The vehicle is malfunctioning and dangerous. It randomly applies the brakes and tries to steer itself at highway speed if there is any obstruction to the sensors. I had to fight the steering wheel to keep it on the road when driving down the middle of the lane. Having the car applying the brakes randomly at highway speed is also incredibly dangerous. I can't control how close semi trucks follow and several almost rear ended me. They also got very upset because they thought I was doing it on purpose. I can't wash the vehicle every time it snows or pull over every time it rains hard. The dealers suggestions are not practical. The malfunctioning lane keeper assist and automatic breaking on this vehicle is an accident waiting to happen. Or it's already happened and isn't getting the credit it deserves.

I'd complained about that issue since buying the car. I'd also complained since purchase about frequent false collision mitigation system errors some of which engaged the brakes. On Monday May 3, 2021 I was on a highway off-ramp going about 30 MPH when my steering wheel suddenly locked up, the collision mitigation system sounded, the brakes engaged, and the car began to swerve into the oncoming lane over the double yellow lines. I was momentarily unable to drive back into my own lane because the steering wheel was locked. A few seconds later, the car went back to normal and I was able to put my blinker on and pull over into the breakdown lane. I was very frightened so I took a few minutes to calm down. Luckily, there were no oncoming vehicles and no one behind me when it happened. On May 5, 2021 I was driving my vehicle on I-95 at approximately the speed limit of 65 MPH when the steering wheel again locked up, the brakes briefly auto-engaged, and the a/c unit shut off. I was in heavy traffic and was immediately concerned I would be rear-ended and/or drift into another lane causing an accident. Luckily, the steering wheel unlocked within a few seconds and the brakes stopped engaging. I was able to regain control before there was an accident. Shortly thereafter, I had the car serviced at the dealership. The mechanics said the sensor was slightly off but that didn't explain the steering wheel locking up and other symptoms. At my insistence, they dug further and consulted Honda mechanics. That research pointed them to the battery. They fixed a loose battery terminal and said that could explain the issues I was having. I learned by my own research that 2019 Honda Odysseys had a recall for a similar issue. The dealership indicated they were doing me a favor to ""help you out"" and this was a one-time thing. I would have to pay for any future work or escalate to Honda. 							- Oakland, ME, USA"

System would generally reset but only after 30 seconds of non visibility to my speed, cruise control status etc.. took it back for 4th visit. They stated they found an issue with tailgate sensor. Picked it up on Friday Oct 4th and it started making the crackling noise in the speakers again yesterday, Oct 5th. Last time, it eventually got worse until speedometer stopped working. Plan to make another appt (my 5th) this week. Craclking noise occurs when stopped, when driving, when vehicle is turned off (after being on). Video and speedometer display stop working when driving.							- Arlington, TN, USA"

3867,Honda,Pilot,2020,electrical problems,Infotainment System Crackling Noise,Pilot Touring V6,Automatic transmission,150 miles,"I have a brand new 2020 Honda Pilot. It has 3 miles on it when we bought it. We paid over 50,000 for it. I needed a car that was safe, as I drive my grand babies often! I needed a car that was big as I often have 5 passengers. I needed a car that was comfortable as I am disabled and have major back issues. We settled on the Pilot for these reasons. Shortly after we bought it at about 1000 miles we noticed it was having issues! I would get a horrible cracklings noise in the car that was so loud you couldn’t hear one another talk. As well as the crackle my cell phone would not work. I was unable to place calls or text messages. The dash would also blink on and off like it was trying to reset. When it would do this I would lose everything on the entire dash as well as the on board computer. So this meant I had nothing to tell me my speed. No gages at all! It was and continues to be unsafe! I called South Tacoma Honda and told them what was happening. I told them I would need to be given a free loaner car that was big enough for the babies as well as would be big enough (no cars) for my back. They said they would do their best to accommodate this. I was given a small car. I once again stated why I needed a larger suv or truck comparable to the one I have. I was told this was all they had. I then had to wait a week to get my car fixed! When I was told it was ready they said they hoped the got it fixed! I hope so too! I drove it away. Within a few days the car started doing the exact same things yet again. I called to make yet another appointment. I informed them once again that I needed a free loaner car and why as well as what type. I informed them I am disabled and I can’t do a small car. Once again they gave me a small car because that was all they had. They once again had my car for a week. I was also in the process of moving. When I needed to move I told them I needed my car back because the car was too small to move with and I could now hardly walk after driving this car for a week once again. It is much to low to the ground for me which is a huge problem - I don’t have a car! They said good news they just got my car fixed it was ready! I went to pick it up so I could do my move. The car did appear to be fixed for a few days! Then the crackle came back. When it starts at first it is an intermittent issue then it gets worse and worse impacting all issues such as phone and on board computer. I had to wait this time as my life was too hectic right then to possibly be without my car again. I contacted my service manager however to let him know the issue was still happening and I would need to bring it back in. I must also mention that I was told by multiple people at this dealership that this issue is happening with other people as well with 2020 pilots. I’m not sure if that is supposed to make me feel better or worse. Last week I had time to take my car in. It had gotten very bad again. I once again stated what type of loaner car I would need and why. I was pleased to be given the South Tacoma Honda courtesy van as it could accommodate my needs while they have my car. I needed an oil change, a wheel scratch fixed a window fix as well as the crackle fix and issue with the on board computer fixed. I was told that my car was part of a big 2020 Honda Pilot recall and that recall would likely be the fix to my issues. I was told all of the work would be done but it would probably take a week or more. I was fine with that as I finally had an appropriate loaner to drive. A few days later I got the call that my work would be done minus the recall because Honda doesn’t have the parts for the recall. I was told this could take days... weeks... months??? They don’t know how long. But rest assured.... I’m not the only one! Then the big news hits! I learn they someone that is an awesome source and also works for Honda that this was not true! The parts are in... but Honda is not using them for cars that were already bought! They are using them for the new Honda’s on the lot so they can sell those! What? Are you kidding me? So I asked that I keep the van until my Honda can be fixed! Today I get the call that I need to bring the van back tomorrow they need it and some of my work was done! I directly ask if the recall work is done I am told to bring the van back tomorrow with no answer on recall work which tells me the answer is no! I then ask for contact names and phone numbers for upper management as well as that persons boss. I have been ghosted since. So it’s South Tacoma’s best practice to have someone in a dangerous vehicle for possibly months so they can fix the cars first that they have not sold so they can make money? Not OK! I had mentioned that I had it in 3 times for over a week each as I check my records its been 4 times each time 7 to 10 days. Tonight once I finally wrote this, posted on social media, news outlets, attorney general so on, I get a call at 8 pm saying that they fixed my car and did the recall work! Now hoping my issue is resolved!				- Kim V.,				Orting, WA, US"

This is a safety issue and needs these vehicles recalled. It could startle someone and end up crashing the car. The only way to fix this temporarily is disconnect the lighting cable. The dealer says Honda is aware of the issue but has no fix for it. Hey Honda, how about you buy back my car and I look elsewhere.

It was annoying but when the instrument panel and computer screen blacked out, while I was driving, that was it. I had to pull over and park. Left the vehicle off for about 15 minutes before everything would come back up. Took it to the dealer I purchased from and they found some amplifier wires loosely connected at the back of the vehicle. They said they tightened things up and sent me on my way.All was well for 2 months. The crackling came back. This time I took it to my local dealer. They found crimped wiring throughout the vehicle and had to rewire it all. I'm hoping this is the final fix for this crackling issue.

But now after only one month of buying this 2020 Pilot and my wife telling me about a strange popping noise coming from the speakers, I knew something wasn't right. I took it for a 40 mile drive to see what was going on and experienced it all myself, and this crackling/popping noise is a pain in the butt. It will happen more as you are going on the highway over any overpass or little bump on the road. Then the whole dash and infotainment system crashes, everything went black and then came back on after 20 seconds. I read a lot comments online about these problems on 2017, 18 and 19 Pilots. How is Honda making the same car with the same problem knowing that this is happening to Pilots and even the new Passport and Odyssey? I'm not going to keep a brand new car with this problem, I will take this lemon to the dealer and see what they're going to do. If they don't find a solution, this is my second and last Honda.				- Alexis M.,				Miami, FL, US"

I took to the dealer and they hard-booted the system which seemed to fix it. However a few days following, there is now an annoying crackle that comes from the speakers which sounds like little pebbles hitting the glass. I transport girls several times and I’m concerned it’s an electrical short. I have an appointment at the dealer today but I’m frustrated that this is an expensive car that has now been in the dealer 2 times in 2 months. I’m feeling really good that I got an extended warranty but this is super inconvenient. If you look up the 2019 models they are all having these same issues.				- Alissa F.,				Johnsburg, US"
3901,Honda,Pilot,2020,interior accessories problems,NHTSA: Equipment: Electrical: Infotainment,Pilot, miles,,"			I have constantly had to bring my car in again for the same problem since I bought it brand new in May 2020. On September 22, the audio/entertainment system completely shut down-�""it stopped playing music from the device connected to it and would not connect to a new device. The console then went completely black, and the audio system began to crackle incessantly, even when I turned it off. When I turned off the ignition and restarted the car, there was an error message on the display: -��No Audio Connection-�� This had already happened multiple times since I had brought the car in for this problem a year prior. In some cases, I lost all displays, meaning I had no GPS, speedometer, fuel indicator, or other safety indicators. Each time I called and/or I brought the car to the dealership, I was told that sometimes the system just crashes and that I should -��reset it by restarting the car, just like an iPhone.-�� However, this has never actually worked. In every instance, I had to restart the car 2-5 times and hope that the system would correct itself. Usually it did not, and I would just have to wait for hours or even days before the entertainment system would spontaneously begin functioning again. When it happened in September, I brought the car in and demanded that something be done. After a day, a service advisor called me and said the previous repair from a year ago was done incorrectly, which led to recurring problems with the wiring harness. You can imagine how furious I was since I had to bring the car back several times during the first ordeal in 2020. Fast forward another 24 days (October 16), and the same problem occurs. When I lividly informed the service department that I was having problems again, I was informed that this is a common issue with 2019 and 2020 models (citing a lawsuit that was filed against Honda). The dealer was fully aware that these cars have this problem that pose a severe threat to passenger safety, yet it continues to sell them.							- Chantilly, VA, USA"

This has nearly caused an accident on two different occasions. Each time the lane we are in is clear and usually doesn't even have a vehicle in front of us. 2. when in cruise control the acc will detect a vehicle in front of us going maybe 2 mhp slower than our set speed and our car will abruptly slow down to about 10 mph below the acc set point. Then it detects there is clear distance to the vehicle in front and will abruptly accelerate till it again detects the vehicle and then repeats the same actions - abrupt slowdown - abrupt acceleration and so on vs. A gradual slowdown to match the vehicle in front speed and holding steady at that speed. I have set the distance detection to each setting and it makes no difference. 3. lane keep assist is plain down dangerous. Tried to merge onto a busy highway with turn signal on and the lka would not let us merge and jerked the wheel back to the right and the vehicle abruptly hit the brakes when there was nothing in front of us. Nearly caused traffic behind to rear end us. 4. hands free cell feature is not hands free if connected to apply car play. This was not what we were lead to believe at the time of sale. Honda has some serious issues with the Honda sensing and a recall is a must as these issues will eventually cause an accident and I have to assume already have.

I brought my Pilot elite into the dealership on December 26, 2019 after discovering a popping noise which sounded like a firecracker going off that seemed to be between the windshield and dash while driving.mileage was at 3,956 at this time. On January 17, 2020, I brought my Honda Pilot into the dealership again. It developed a popping noise again between the windshield and dash sounding like a firecracker going off when I was driving. On February 5, 2020, the Honda Pilot was once again brought back in. It was popping and cracking this time in the audio unit but now also door locks we're making noise when in stationary or while driving. The control panel had also shut off a couple times where you only saw a dark screen and it would reboot. On July 14th, after hearing this loud popping noise for a couple months now while driving, I have taken it back to the dealership. It is worse when you go around any type of curves or on bumpy roads. If the road is completely straight and smooth, I do not have this problem. This whole ordeal is scary because it is a huge distraction for me and I fear for my safety. I have been told by the service advisor again today that Honda is aware and working on this issue. He stated a recall is coming out for it as well as the Odyssey and passport but they are making the parts for it before they recall it. He said they can put a band-aid on it in the meantime until the part can be made. Since this is the 2nd time in the last 6 months I have been told this, I'm worried they are covering up the issue and waiting for my warranty to be up. Also, the sensor that tells you when a vehicle or object is close to you is faulty. I will be driving with nothing around me and it tells me to brake and goes into its 'safety mode' which has caused me to almost have a wreck.							- Harvest, AL, USA"

The console then went completely black, and the audio system began to crackle incessantly, even when I turned it off. When I turned off the ignition and restarted the car, there was an error message on the display: -��No Audio Connection-�� This had already happened multiple times since I had brought the car in for this problem a year prior.

The engine will shut off automatically, but when I lift my foot from the brake, the car engine does not turn back on, and the car shifts into park, and acts as if stalled. In order to get the car to restart, I have to power down completely, open the driver side door(!!!) and -��reset-�� the whole system before I can apply the brake and press the ignition button. Even then a couple of times it doesn-��t start for me doing that, and I have to cycle through the entire process a second time.

Recently this month December 2020, I started hearing a cracking and popping noise from the speakers. The popping noise happens whether or not music is on. I also started hearing this weird noise that almost sounded like there was a compressor in my vehicle. I did some research on several Honda Pilot threads and it seems to be the ac compressor and the speakers. Apparently the wiring harness needs to be changed. I've looked over the NHTSA website and seen multiple complaints regarding the speakers popping issue. I have not taken my vehicle to the dealer yet, I dont completely trust dealership service centers and they prey on customers and over charge and make you think there's other things wrong with the vehicle. I like to do my research prior to taking my cars to any repair shops. I also video and voice recorded all the weird sounds that the Pilot is making. Honda needs to fix this, if this in fact is a wiring issue, this can possibly cause a short out thus a safety issue. I will be printing out several of these complaints and showing them to the dealer before they try to swindle me out of an excess amount of money. Although since it hasn't even been a year my vehicle should be under warranty.							- Daly City, CA, USA"

3992,Honda,Pilot,2020,engine problems,NHTSA: Vehicle Speed Control,Pilot,"6,000 miles",,"			1. car flashes brake and sometimes brakes on its own when it detects an object along the side of the road or when a car may be approaching in the opposite lane or in a center turning lane. This has nearly caused an accident on two different occasions. Each time the lane we are in is clear and usually doesn't even have a vehicle in front of us. 2. when in cruise control the acc will detect a vehicle in front of us going maybe 2 mhp slower than our set speed and our car will abruptly slow down to about 10 mph below the acc set point. Then it detects there is clear distance to the vehicle in front and will abruptly accelerate till it again detects the vehicle and then repeats the same actions - abrupt slowdown - abrupt acceleration and so on vs. A gradual slowdown to match the vehicle in front speed and holding steady at that speed. I have set the distance detection to each setting and it makes no difference. 3. lane keep assist is plain down dangerous. Tried to merge onto a busy highway with turn signal on and the lka would not let us merge and jerked the wheel back to the right and the vehicle abruptly hit the brakes when there was nothing in front of us. Nearly caused traffic behind to rear end us. 4. hands free cell feature is not hands free if connected to apply car play. This was not what we were lead to believe at the time of sale. Honda has some serious issues with the Honda sensing and a recall is a must as these issues will eventually cause an accident and I have to assume already have. To date the car is unsafe with the sensing on and if I turn it off I risk liability with my insurance as they provide discounts because of the Honda sensing safety features.							- Holtwood, PA, USA"

In fact there is a class action lawsuit for those model years for the same exact issue. But now, having been to the NHTSA site, I see that it is also an issue for new 2020 models with very low mileage. This is a big problem and needs to be investigated immediately as everything that the driver needs to safely monitor their driving is affected by this problem and vehicle owners are not getting help from their local Honda dealership service departments. A national recall for safety needs to be issued right away and pressure on Honda to find a solution and fix should be required by law! our local Honda dealership did state that there appears to be a problem with the wiring harness, but it only temporarily fixes the issue after being replaced.							- Palm Bay, FL, USA"

While monitoring the tire pressure for two weeks, I've noticed that both driver side front and rear tires have been considerably low and we haven't added any air since. I figured it was because of heat/time of day. My last drive at 80 degrees at sunset ended with both driver side tires at 33 psi and both passenger side tires around 35-37 psi. This morning both driver side tires were at 33 psi on a cold start at about 60 degrees, once I got onto the same highway and lanes I have been driving on for the past 2 weeks, I noticed the man behind me waving his arms wildly. I checked my tire pressure on the dash and noticed the rear driver side was suddenly at 24psi, 20, 17, 10 and I pulled over to change the tire.

My family and I were driving on the highway at about 70 mph when all of a sudden the car wouldn't accelerate and in fact lost power. The engine light was flashing and we were fortunate to have an exit ramp close and we coasted off on the exit ramp limited to 5 mph. All electronics were on (radio and dvd), but the car forced us to a stop. We called the Honda service line because this car is still under warranty. They informed us not to drive the car at this time with the engine light on. We sat in the car with the engine light on and pulled over for approximately 20 minutes. They recommended turning the car off for 10 minutes, like manual said, and then restart the car to see if we can drive to safety. We did this and the engine light was off and we were able to drive to a safe location. 100+ miles away from our home, we took it to a Honda dealer. They did an inspection of the car and attempted to read the system to find out why the engine light came on. They wrote up a detailed report and said that the engine light may not have been on long enough to get a read/report, but everything else looked ok. They did write in their report that there is a known bulletin for a fuel injection problem. They said they recommended it, but that the engine light would need to be on longer to justify recall. And lastly, I want you to be aware that this car, since purchasing new, has been in the shop or not correctly working for 4+ month of the year we have owned it.

The vehicle was initially towed to an independent tow yard and was later towed to an independent body shop for repair by insurance. The manufacturer was notified of the failure and offered no assistance. The vehicle had yet to be repaired. The failure mileage was approximately 28,000. 							- Towaco, NJ, USA"

4016,Honda,Pilot,2020,steering problems,NHTSA: Steering,Pilot,"6,000 miles",,"			1. car flashes brake and sometimes brakes on its own when it detects an object along the side of the road or when a car may be approaching in the opposite lane or in a center turning lane. This has nearly caused an accident on two different occasions. Each time the lane we are in is clear and usually doesn't even have a vehicle in front of us. 2. when in cruise control the acc will detect a vehicle in front of us going maybe 2 mhp slower than our set speed and our car will abruptly slow down to about 10 mph below the acc set point. Then it detects there is clear distance to the vehicle in front and will abruptly accelerate till it again detects the vehicle and then repeats the same actions - abrupt slowdown - abrupt acceleration and so on vs. A gradual slowdown to match the vehicle in front speed and holding steady at that speed. I have set the distance detection to each setting and it makes no difference. 3. lane keep assist is plain down dangerous. Tried to merge onto a busy highway with turn signal on and the lka would not let us merge and jerked the wheel back to the right and the vehicle abruptly hit the brakes when there was nothing in front of us. Nearly caused traffic behind to rear end us. 4. hands free cell feature is not hands free if connected to apply car play. This was not what we were lead to believe at the time of sale. Honda has some serious issues with the Honda sensing and a recall is a must as these issues will eventually cause an accident and I have to assume already have. To date the car is unsafe with the sensing on and if I turn it off I risk liability with my insurance as they provide discounts because of the Honda sensing safety features.							- Holtwood, PA, USA"

Maybe it's just bad luck! As I mentioned in my previous complaint, I always take special care to stay back at least 500 ft. behind a dump truck and I don't tailgate anyone, especially a big truck. Just as in the other incident, the chip occurred up near the top of the windshield in the shaded area, so I didn't even notice it until a few hours later when the crack had extended down into my view.Again, I hesitate saying this is Honda's fault, but I have a hard time believing this just coincidence. My main reason for registering this complaint is to see if I'm the only one who seems to be having a problem with windshield damage on a Honda Pilot.

When it was my turn to pull up, the vehicle went into neutral on it's own. I pushed the gas and it stayed into neutral. I pushed the brake as well as the button to switch it to drive and it still did not change. On the dash, it was beeping at me to push the brake, then shift. I kept trying that repeatedly, but it would not get out of neutral or shift to any other gear. After spending over a minute on this and cars lining up behind me, I turned the vehicle off which changed it to ""park"" by default. When I turned it back on, it allowed me to shift into drive and get off the speed bump. I feel this is an important concern Honda should investigate as it's happened to me on 2 occasions.				- G P.,				Albuquerque, NM, US"

It beeped at me and showed on the dash to step on the brake, then shift. I tried that as well with no luck. I tried to put it into park then which the dash next advised. This still did not work. I tried by stepping on the brake and simply just pushing the P button. Lastly after dealing with this for well over 2 minutes, I turned the vehicle off completely.

4032,Honda,Pilot,2022,AC / heater problems,A/C Blowing Warm Air,Pilot Touring 3.5L Liter Vtec V6,Automatic transmission,123 miles," I just purchased a new 2022 Pilot (180 miles) early June. The AC does not blow crisp cold air. The inside of the vent temperature should be as low as 44 so when it blows out of the vent its 58 degrees as shown on the dashboard of the car. On the new 2022 Pilot, the lowest it reads is an internal vent temperature of 58. The weather here is only going to get hotter and more humid, and now I have a car that its uncomfortable to ride in for long distances because the inside temperature is too hot, because the AC is blowing warm air, not cold air. I’ve taken it into the dealership 3 times so far for them to fix it. The last visit I was told by Honda Service department that this was the way this car was designed and there is nothing they can do. Excuse me, that response is unacceptable. The dash board clearly states what that vehicle is capable of, and that is the expectation us consumers expect. Otherwise, it’s false advertising. If the AC only runs at its optimal best in a set of certain parameters, then Honda need to have consumers sign a waiver prior to purchasing the vehicle acknowledging that if you live in certain climates, you may experience XYZ situations arise with your AC and Heater, then us consumers can make an informed decision whether or not we want to purchase that vehicle. Had I known this, I would not have purchase the new 2022 Honda Pilot. Word of warning to all consumers - take a thermometer with you and test the AC if you live in a hot humid climate.				- Susan B.,				Houston, US"
