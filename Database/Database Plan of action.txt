Data Schemas required for Post Request.

#Case 1: Only one database is there

--------------------------
Nodes:
[
{
   "labels":"",
   "Properties":{
	"id":""
	"Name":"",
 	"type":"",
 	"description":""
    }
}
]

labels represents types of nodes. eg.Car,Model,Problem,Solution
Properties:
  Car:  (Id,Name,type)
  Model : (Id,Name,Model year,type)
  Problem : (Id,desc,type)
  Solution : (Id,Name, type)
--------------------------

Relationship: 
[
{
    "start": Node_id,
    "end": Node_id,
    "type": "Problem",
    "properties": {
	"relation": "Misfire"
     }
},
]

types represent what kind of relationship does the two nodes have and it leads to
eg.
Node1 -> Node2 ==> type of relation
Car-> Model ==> Model 
Model->Problem ==> Problem
Problem->Problem ==> Problem
Problem->Solution ==> Solution

------------------------------------
Steps to add new logic tree in database.

1.Create a list of all the nodes with predefine schema.
2.Iterate through each node check if node present in database.
 if present:
    do not add.
 else:
    Add the node.
#Now all the nodes in logics has been added.
3.Create a list of all relations we have in logic tree.
4.Iterate through all the relations and add it in database.
