#To add logic tree in database
Check:
1.If Car,Make,Model present?
   => If yes, If any relation with logic tree is there?
      => If yes, do not add logic tree
      =>If No, Match Car,Make,Model and store there id  
  =>If No,Create Car,Make,Model and store the id


#Same question for commmon logic tree of different models may be there,so we have to create different nodes for them.
#for eg. for toyota misfire and lexus misfire, there maybe having same question giving different outcome.
#but possible_problem node must be common.


2.Now we got the id of Car Model(starting point of logic tree) Create furthur:
There maybe a different logic tree present or may not be. So traverse the tree from car's model node and store all node ids in list.
node_list = []#empty if car model has no logic tree.
step1: Read the inputs from xl sheet one by one. (node1,relation,node2)
step2: Check if node with (props) are present in database.
      => If Node type == "Possible_Problem"
           =>If yes, return the id.
           =>If no,Create the Node and return the id.
      => Else:
          => if No, Create the node and return the id.
          => if yes, Check if the id is in node ids list of that tree.(to check if the node is from same logic tree.)
                 => if Yes, return that id.
                 => if No, Create a new node and return the id.
Step3: Now we got id1,id2 now create a relationship. and add this ids in node id's list.
Step4: Repeat Step2 and step3.
